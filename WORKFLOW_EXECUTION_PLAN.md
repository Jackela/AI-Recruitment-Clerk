## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

### **PHASE 1: Critical Infrastructure Recovery** [4-6 hours]
**Start Immediately** - Blocking all other progress

#### **Step 1.1: Emergency Dependency Installation** [30 min]
```bash
# EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY
npm install @nestjs/schedule @nestjs/throttler @types/node-fetch
npm audit fix --force

# VALIDATE
npm run build | grep -i error
```
**Expected Outcome**: Dependency conflicts resolved, build errors reduced by 60%

#### **Step 1.2: Frontend TypeScript Crisis Resolution** [1-2 hours]
**Target**: `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/store/guest/guest.reducer.ts`

**Critical Fix**:
```typescript
// Line 121 - URGENT FIX
feedbackCode: { 
  status: 'generated' as const, // Add 'as const' 
  code: action.payload.code 
}

// Line 143 - URGENT FIX  
feedbackCode: { 
  status: 'redeemed' as const, // Add 'as const'
  code: action.payload.code 
}
```
**Expected Outcome**: Frontend builds successfully, unlocks E2E testing

#### **Step 1.3: Backend Service Compilation Recovery** [1-2 hours]
**Priority Targets**:

1. **Fix User DTO Type Issues**:
   ```typescript
   // apps/app-gateway/src/guest/controllers/guest-resume.controller.spec.ts
   const mockResult = {
     // ... existing properties
     remainingUsage: 2, // ADD THIS LINE
   };
   ```

2. **Repair Corrupted Service Files**:
   - `service-integration.interceptor.ts` - Remove embedded `\n` characters
   - Restore proper TypeScript formatting

**Expected Outcome**: All 5 backend services compile successfully

### **PHASE 2: Test Infrastructure Restoration** [2-3 hours]
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 must achieve 100% build success

#### **Step 2.1: Test Database Isolation Setup** [1 hour]
```typescript
// Create: test/mongodb-test-setup.ts
import { MongoMemoryServer } from 'mongodb-memory-server';

export const setupTestEnvironment = async () => {
  const mongod = await MongoMemoryServer.create({
    instance: { dbName: 'test-ai-recruitment-' + Date.now() }
  });
  return mongod.getUri();
};
```
**Expected Outcome**: Tests run against isolated database, no connection conflicts

#### **Step 2.2: Unit Test Stabilization** [1 hour]
**Targets**:
- Guest effects store mocking improvements
- Component lifecycle test fixes  
- Service integration mock completion

**Expected Outcome**: >95% unit test success rate (>295/311 tests passing)

#### **Step 2.3: E2E Test Infrastructure** [1 hour]
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
npm install --save-dev @types/node @playwright/test

# Configure E2E environment
# Update playwright.config.ts with proper timeout and server config
```
**Expected Outcome**: E2E tests execute without infrastructure failures

### **PHASE 3: Integration & Deployment Readiness** [1-2 hours]
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 must achieve >90% test success

#### **Step 3.1: Service Integration Validation** [30 min]
```typescript
// Add health endpoints to all services
@Get('health')
async healthCheck() {
  return {
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    services: await this.validateConnections()
  };
}
```
**Expected Outcome**: All services respond to health checks with 200 status

#### **Step 3.2: Performance & Quality Gates** [30 min]
```bash
# Execute all 8 quality gates
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm audit && npm run test:coverage
```
**Expected Outcome**: 8/8 quality gates passing, performance within SLA

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Protocol

### **Critical Risk Points**

**Risk 1: TypeScript Breaking Changes** [High Impact]
- **Detection**: Build fails after dependency updates
- **Response**: Rollback dependencies, apply fixes incrementally
- **Prevention**: Validate each change before proceeding

**Risk 2: Test Database Conflicts** [Medium Impact]  
- **Detection**: Tests fail with connection errors
- **Response**: Reset test database, check port conflicts
- **Prevention**: Use random port allocation

**Risk 3: Performance Regression** [Medium Impact]
- **Detection**: Response times >200ms
- **Response**: Revert last change, profile performance
- **Prevention**: Continuous performance monitoring

### **Escalation Procedures**

**If Phase 1 Exceeds 6 Hours**:
1. Focus on frontend fixes only (highest impact)
2. Deploy backend with current stable versions
3. Escalate to senior architect for complex TypeScript issues

**If Test Success <90%**:
1. Identify top 3 test failure patterns
2. Temporarily disable non-critical tests
3. Focus on core business logic validation only

**If Performance Degrades >20%**:
1. Immediately revert to last known good state
2. Implement performance monitoring dashboards
3. Conduct isolated performance testing
