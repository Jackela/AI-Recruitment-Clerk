class ProductionSecurityValidator {
  validateSecrets(): SecurityValidationResult {
    const issues: string[] = [];
    
    if (process.env.JWT_SECRET?.includes('change-in-production')) {
      issues.push('JWT_SECRET contains default value');
    }
    
    if (!/^[a-f0-9]{64}$/i.test(process.env.ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY || '')) {
      issues.push('ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY is not 64-char hex');
    }
    
    return { isValid: issues.length === 0, issues };
  }
}

// Add to application startup
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  const validation = new ProductionSecurityValidator().validateSecrets();
  if (!validation.isValid) {
