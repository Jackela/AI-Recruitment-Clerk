  <button>Click me</button>
</app-microinteraction>
```

### Smart File Upload Integration
```typescript
<app-smart-file-upload
  [config]="{
    maxFiles: 10,
    intelligentCategorization: true,

  (filesSelected)="onFilesSelected($event)"
  (batchCompleted)="onBatchComplete($event)">
</app-smart-file-upload>
```

### Predictive Autocomplete Setup
```typescript
<app-predictive-autocomplete
  [config]="{
    context: 'job_title',
    enableLearning: true,
    showConfidence: true
  }"
  [(ngModel)]="selectedJobTitle"
  (suggestionSelected)="onSuggestionSelected($event)">
</app-predictive-autocomplete>
