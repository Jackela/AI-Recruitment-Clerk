# Implementation Plan: Functional Acceptance and Usability Validation

**Branch**: `001-functional-acceptance` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: specs/001-functional-acceptance/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-functional-acceptance/spec.md`

## Summary

Establish a repeatable, auditable acceptance process covering P1 and P2 scope with:
- A catalog of P1 journeys and feature acceptance cases mapped to FR/US/SC IDs
- Checklists defining expected outcomes and result states (Pass/Fail/Blocked)
- Evidence collection and storage conventions with run metadata
- Defect triage and re‑verification workflow
- Joint sign‑off report for Product Owner and QA Lead

No application code changes are planned for this feature; deliverables are documentation,
checklists, and folder structure supporting acceptance evidence.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: N/A (documentation/process)  
**Primary Dependencies**: N/A  
**Storage**: Git‑tracked evidence under `specs/001-functional-acceptance/evidence/`  
**Testing**: Requirements quality checklists; traceability cross‑checks  
**Target Platform**: N/A  
**Project Type**: Documentation/process in `specs/`  
**Performance Goals**: N/A  
**Constraints**: Align with Constitution governance; no secrets; predictable structure  
**Scale/Scope**: P1 + P2 acceptance coverage this round

## Constitution Check

- Clean Architecture: No code; does not impact layering. PASS
- TDD: No code; tests in this context are requirements quality checklists. PASS
- DDD: No new domain models introduced. PASS
- SOLID: Not applicable (no classes/modules). PASS
- Fail‑Fast & Observability: Evidence & metadata structure enables diagnosis of acceptance failures. PASS

**Structure Decision**: Keep all acceptance assets within the feature folder for traceability.
