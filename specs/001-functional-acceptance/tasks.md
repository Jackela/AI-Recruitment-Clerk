# Tasks: 001-functional-acceptance

**Input**: spec.md, plan.md in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (present), spec.md (present). No application code changes in scope.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- [P] = can run in parallel
- [Story] = US1, US2, US3 from spec.md
- Include exact file paths

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Documentation Structure)

- [X] T001 [P] [US2] Create folders: `specs/001-functional-acceptance/{checklists,evidence,runs,reports}`
- [X] T002 [P] [US2] Add `.gitkeep` to `specs/001-functional-acceptance/evidence/` and `runs/` (optional)
- [X] T003 [US2] Add `specs/001-functional-acceptance/reports/signoff-README.md` with sign‑off instructions

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Acceptance Catalog & Conventions)

- [X] T004 [US1] Create `specs/001-functional-acceptance/acceptance-catalog.md` with Acceptance Case IDs for P1 journeys and P2 features; map to FR/SC
- [X] T005 [P] [US2] Define evidence conventions in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/evidence-guidelines.md` (paths, naming, required types)
- [X] T006 [P] [US2] Define run metadata schema and Run ID format in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/runs/README.md` (JSON keys per D‑004)
- [X] T007 [US3] Document defect triage & re‑verification in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/defect-process.md` (links to tracker)
- [X] T008 [US2] Document result states (Pass/Fail/Blocked) in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/result-states.md` aligned to D‑002

**Checkpoint**: Catalog and conventions ready; scenario checklists can be authored.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Validate Core Feature Usability (P1)

### Requirements-Quality Tests (author first)

- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Author P1 journey Acceptance Cases in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/checklists/p1-journeys.md` referencing FR‑001, SC‑003
- [X] T010 [US1] Add time measurement guidance to checklists (timestamps, start/stop definition)

### Implementation (documentation)

- [X] T011 [US1] Populate `acceptance-catalog.md` with P1 journey Acceptance Case IDs and expected outcomes
- [X] T012 [US1] Add recovery/alternate/exception flow entries per journey in catalog

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Comprehensive Functional Acceptance (P2)

### Requirements-Quality Tests

- [X] T013 [P] [US2] Author P2 feature Acceptance Cases in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/checklists/p2-features.md` referencing FR‑002, SC‑002

### Implementation (documentation)

- [X] T014 [US2] Populate `acceptance-catalog.md` with P2 feature Acceptance Case IDs and outcomes
- [X] T015 [US2] Add feature flag enablement instructions for flagged features

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Defect Triage and Re‑verification (P3)

- [X] T016 [US3] Define re‑verification template in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/reports/reverify-template.md`
- [X] T017 [P] [US3] Link acceptance cases to defect records (traceability guidance)
- [X] T018 [US3] Define reopen rate calculation note in `reports/signoff-README.md` aligning with SC‑004

---

## Phase N: Sign‑off & Reporting

- [X] T019 [US2] Create `specs/001-functional-acceptance/reports/signoff-template.md` including hard gates for SC‑001/SC‑002 and PO + QA Lead signatures
- [X] T020 [P] [US2] Add index table in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/acceptance-catalog.md` linking cases → evidence → runs

### Additional Artifacts

- [X] T021 [P] [US2] Create sample run file `specs/001-functional-acceptance/runs/RUN-YYYYMMDD-01.json` following D‑004 (use placeholders if needed)
- [X] T022 [US3] Ensure sign‑off template includes “Metrics & Sampling” (SC‑004) and link from `reports/signoff-README.md`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phases 3–5 (3–4 can proceed in parallel after Phase 2)
- US1 and US2 checklists authoring (T009, T013) can run in parallel
