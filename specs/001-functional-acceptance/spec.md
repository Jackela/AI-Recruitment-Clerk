# Feature Specification: Functional Acceptance and Usability Validation

**Feature Branch**: `001-functional-acceptance`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我们目任务是保证项目的可用性 验收所有功能 确保真实可用"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23

- Q: Acceptance scope — Include P2 features or limit to P1 only for this milestone? → A: P1 + P2 (together in this round)
- Q: Acceptance authority for final sign‑off? → A: Joint sign‑off (Product Owner + QA Lead)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Validate Core Feature Usability (Priority: P1)

As a business owner, I need to verify that all core user journeys can be completed
end-to-end without assistance so that the product is truly usable.

**Why this priority**: Ensures product delivers immediate value and is ready for release.

**Independent Test**: Execute acceptance scenarios for each P1 journey and record pass/fail
with evidence (screenshots/recordings/notes). No developer tools or internal access required.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a prepared test account, When executing each P1 journey step-by-step,
   Then the journey completes without blocking issues and produces expected outcomes.
2. Given ambiguous inputs or minor mistakes, When retrying with guidance on-screen,
   Then the user can recover and still complete the task within 3 minutes per SC‑003.

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Functional Acceptance (Priority: P2)

As a QA/acceptance lead, I need documented acceptance for all declared features so that
we have traceable evidence that the system works as intended.

**Why this priority**: Provides coverage beyond core journeys and reduces regression risk.

**Independent Test**: For each feature listed in the product requirements, run the defined
acceptance checklist and capture evidence of expected results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the feature acceptance checklist, When executing each step, Then the observed
   result matches the expected behavior and is recorded as "Accepted" with evidence.

---

### User Story 3 - Defect Triage and Re‑verification (Priority: P3)

As an acceptance owner, I need a process to capture defects found during acceptance and
confirm fixes so that the acceptance status remains accurate.

**Why this priority**: Ensures discovered issues are resolved and verified before release.

**Independent Test**: Create a defect record with reproduction steps and expected behavior;
upon fix, re‑run the original acceptance scenario and mark as passed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a reported defect with reproduction steps, When a fix is delivered,
   Then the original scenario executes successfully and the defect is closed.

### Edge Cases

- Features behind configuration/feature flags require instructions and explicit enablement.  
- External dependency instability (e.g., third‑party services) during acceptance windows.  
- Data inconsistencies in test environments leading to false negatives.  
- Session expiration or intermittent network issues while executing long flows.  
- Conflicting system states after partial failures; acceptance must re‑initialize cleanly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: A catalog of core user journeys (P1) MUST be defined and accepted with
  documented evidence for each journey.
- FR-002: All declared features in the product requirements MUST have an acceptance
  checklist with expected outcomes and pass/fail status recorded.
- FR-003: Each acceptance run MUST record: date/time, executor, environment, evidence
  reference(s), and result (Pass/Fail/Blocked).
- FR-004: Defects discovered during acceptance MUST be logged with reproduction steps,
  severity, and expected behavior; fixes MUST be re‑verified before acceptance closure.
- FR-005: Usability validation (part of FR‑001) MUST confirm that target users can complete
  each P1 journey without assistance and without S1/S2 issues.
- FR-006: Acceptance scope MUST cover P1 and P2 features in this round.
- FR-007: Acceptance authority MUST be a joint sign‑off by the Product Owner and QA Lead.

### Clarifications & Definitions

- D-001: "Without assistance" means no guidance beyond on‑screen affordances and help text.
  External help (chat, docs outside UI, dev tools) invalidates the run for SC‑003.
- D-002: Result states are defined as:
  - Pass: Expected outcome achieved; no S1/S2 defects observed (see `specs/001-functional-acceptance/defect-process.md` §Severity).
  - Fail: Expected outcome not achieved due to product behavior; reproducible.
  - Blocked: Execution cannot proceed due to environment, data, or dependency issues outside
    product behavior; defect or incident logged and linked.
- D-003: Evidence Artifact must include at least one of: screenshot, screen recording, or
  written notes with timestamps; store under `evidence/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<RUN_ID>/` with stable
  names `[CASE_ID]_[step|result]_NN.(png|mp4|md)` where `NN` is a two‑digit sequence starting at 01 per case artifact. For SC‑003 timing verification, evidence MUST include time‑anchored proof (e.g., timestamped screenshots or screen recordings) sufficient to validate duration.
- D-004: Acceptance Run metadata format: `runs/<RUN_ID>.json` with keys
  `{ id, date, executor, environment, cases: [ { caseId, result, evidence: [paths] } ] }`.
- D-005: Scope Exclusions (this round): P3 enhancements, performance tuning beyond SC‑003,
  non‑blocking cosmetic inconsistencies; these may be noted but do not gate sign‑off.
- D-006: "Target users" for SC‑003 are acceptance testers representing primary user personas
  with normal proficiency, using only public UI knowledge (no insider knowledge, dev tools,
  or privileged guidance). Accessibility accommodations are allowed if applicable to the
  persona.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- Feature: A described capability with defined expected outcomes for acceptance.
- Acceptance Case: A testable scenario with steps, expected results, and evidence links.
- Evidence Artifact: Structured proof of outcome (notes, screenshots, recordings).
- Defect: A variance from expected behavior with severity and reproduction steps.
- Acceptance Run: A dated execution of acceptance cases within a target environment.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: 100% of P1 journeys accepted with evidence and zero critical defects open.
- SC-002: ≥ 95% of acceptance cases across all included features (scope per FR-006) marked
  as Pass; remaining cases have tracked defects with ETA.
- SC-003: ≥ 90% of P1 journeys completed by target users (per D‑006) without assistance within
  3 minutes per journey measured from first actionable UI to final expected outcome; evidence
  includes timestamps to verify duration.
- SC-004: Defect reopen rate during acceptance ≤ 10% across all severities; calculated as
  `reopened_count / closed_count` within the acceptance window; sampling method documented in
  the acceptance report.

## Governance & Alignment

- G-001: This feature introduces documentation and process only; no application code changes.
  Constitution gates (Clean Architecture, TDD, DDD, SOLID, Fail‑Fast/Observability) are not
  violated; any enabling scripts or tools must follow repository standards if added.


## Assumptions

- Acceptance occurs in a stable pre‑release environment representative of production. Environment specifics (versions, configs, feature flags, seed data) are defined in `specs/001-functional-acceptance/environment.md` and MUST be used for acceptance. Feature flag parity, staging service endpoints, and the seed data version MUST match the definitions in `environment.md`.
- Test data and credentials are available and do not require privileged access.
- Evidence storage and tracking follow conventions defined in D‑003 (this spec) and related guidelines; these are authoritative for this feature.
