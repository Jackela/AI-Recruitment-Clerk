# Feature Specification: Functional Acceptance and Usability Validation

**Feature Branch**: `001-functional-acceptance`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我们目任务是保证项目的可用性 验收所有功能 确保真实可用"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23

- Q: Acceptance scope — Include P2 features or limit to P1 only for this milestone? → A: P1 + P2 (together in this round)
- Q: Acceptance authority for final sign‑off? → A: Joint sign‑off (Product Owner + QA Lead)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Validate Core Feature Usability (Priority: P1)

As a business owner, I need to verify that all core user journeys can be completed
end-to-end without assistance so that the product is truly usable.

**Why this priority**: Ensures product delivers immediate value and is ready for release.

**Independent Test**: Execute acceptance scenarios for each P1 journey and record pass/fail
with evidence (screenshots/recordings/notes). No developer tools or internal access required.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a prepared test account, When executing each P1 journey step-by-step,
   Then the journey completes without blocking issues and produces expected outcomes.
2. Given ambiguous inputs or minor mistakes, When retrying with guidance on-screen,
   Then the user can recover and still complete the task within acceptable time.

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Functional Acceptance (Priority: P2)

As a QA/acceptance lead, I need documented acceptance for all declared features so that
we have traceable evidence that the system works as intended.

**Why this priority**: Provides coverage beyond core journeys and reduces regression risk.

**Independent Test**: For each feature listed in the product requirements, run the defined
acceptance checklist and capture evidence of expected results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the feature acceptance checklist, When executing each step, Then the observed
   result matches the expected behavior and is recorded as "Accepted" with evidence.

### User Story 3 - Defect Triage and Re‑verification (Priority: P3)

As an acceptance owner, I need a process to capture defects found during acceptance and
confirm fixes so that the acceptance status remains accurate.

**Why this priority**: Ensures discovered issues are resolved and verified before release.

**Independent Test**: Create a defect record with reproduction steps and expected behavior;
upon fix, re‑run the original acceptance scenario and mark as passed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a reported defect with reproduction steps, When a fix is delivered,
   Then the original scenario executes successfully and the defect is closed.

### Edge Cases

- Features behind configuration/feature flags require instructions and explicit enablement.  
- External dependency instability (e.g., third‑party services) during acceptance windows.  
- Data inconsistencies in test environments leading to false negatives.  
- Session expiration or intermittent network issues while executing long flows.  
- Conflicting system states after partial failures; acceptance must re‑initialize cleanly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: A catalog of core user journeys (P1) MUST be defined and accepted with
  documented evidence for each journey.
- FR-002: All declared features in the product requirements MUST have an acceptance
  checklist with expected outcomes and pass/fail status recorded.
- FR-003: Each acceptance run MUST record: date/time, executor, environment, evidence
  reference, and result (Pass/Fail/Blocked).
- FR-004: Defects discovered during acceptance MUST be logged with reproduction steps,
  severity, and expected behavior; fixes MUST be re‑verified before acceptance closure.
- FR-005: Usability validation MUST confirm that users can complete each P1 journey without
  assistance and without critical issues.
- FR-006: Acceptance scope MUST cover P1 and P2 features in this round.
- FR-007: Acceptance authority MUST be a joint sign‑off by the Product Owner and QA Lead.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- Feature: A described capability with defined expected outcomes for acceptance.
- Acceptance Case: A testable scenario with steps, expected results, and evidence links.
- Evidence Artifact: Structured proof of outcome (notes, screenshots, recordings).
- Defect: A variance from expected behavior with severity and reproduction steps.
- Acceptance Run: A dated execution of acceptance cases within a target environment.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: 100% of P1 journeys accepted with evidence and zero critical defects open.
- SC-002: ≥ 95% of acceptance cases across all included features (scope per FR-006) marked
  as Pass; remaining cases have tracked defects with ETA.
- SC-003: ≥ 90% of P1 journeys completed by target users without assistance within
  3 minutes per journey.
- SC-004: Defect reopen rate during acceptance ≤ 10% across all severities.

## Assumptions

- Acceptance occurs in a stable pre‑release environment representative of production.
- Test data and credentials are available and do not require privileged access.
- Evidence storage and tracking follow existing team conventions for auditability.
