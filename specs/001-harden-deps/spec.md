# Feature Specification: Dependency Vulnerability Hardening

**Feature Branch**: `001-harden-deps`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "hardening the dependencies. The npm audit during dependency-scan still flags 3 high and 13 moderate issues (largely from Playwright/Vite/ validator). Deciding how to address those—updating or pinning, or documenting mitigation—would close the remaining warning in CI. Alternatively, we can tackle the contract drift: the validation workflow highlighted field mismatches between the frontend and backend job models. Reconciling those schemas (or making the divergence intentional and documented) would tighten our API guarantees. Happy to dive into either path next."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Security pipeline clears dependency risks (Priority: P1)

Security reviewers ensure the automated dependency scan no longer reports high-severity issues before approving a release.

**Why this priority**: Eliminating high-severity findings is mandatory for compliance and blocks production deployments until resolved.

**Independent Test**: Trigger the dependency-scan workflow and verify it produces zero high-severity findings without manual overrides.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a dependency scan has been run on the current main branch, **When** the report is generated, **Then** it lists zero high-severity vulnerabilities and zero unresolved moderate vulnerabilities.
2. **Given** a high- or moderate-severity vulnerability is newly detected, **When** the pipeline executes, **Then** it flags the build as non-compliant and references the assigned remediation owner.

### User Story 2 - Engineers update dependencies safely (Priority: P2)

Developers upgrade or pin dependencies to remove vulnerabilities while retaining application stability.

**Why this priority**: Dependency hardening must not break core functionality; developers need confidence that updates keep the system stable.

**Independent Test**: Apply the proposed dependency changes, run automated build/test suites, and confirm no regressions or contract failures appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dependency update plan is applied in a staging branch, **When** automated unit, integration, and contract checks run, **Then** all suites complete successfully without new failures.

---

### User Story 3 - Stakeholders confirm remediation before release (Priority: P3)

Product and security stakeholders track remediation progress so that every moderate vulnerability is resolved prior to granting release approval.

**Why this priority**: Ensures no residual moderate risk reaches production, aligning release governance with security policy.

**Independent Test**: Review the remediation dashboard during release preparation to confirm all moderate findings show completed fixes before sign-off.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** moderate vulnerabilities are identified during the scan, **When** stakeholders conduct the release readiness review, **Then** release approval is withheld until each finding is marked resolved with validation evidence.

### Edge Cases

- Newly introduced transitive dependencies with no available patches still trigger high-severity alerts; mitigation must capture vendor advisories and alternative controls.
- Dependency updates required to remediate vulnerabilities introduce incompatible licensing terms; release decision must document legal approval before proceeding.
- Vulnerability remediation conflicts with pending feature work; change management must ensure coordination to avoid regressions.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Provide an up-to-date dependency vulnerability inventory covering all high and moderate findings, including package name, version, severity, fix availability, and scan timestamp.
- **FR-002**: Record a remediation decision for every high- and moderate-severity vulnerability, documenting the owner, chosen action (upgrade, patch, removal, or mitigation), and target completion date.
- **FR-003**: Ensure the dependency hardening changes allow all automated build, test, contract validation, and security workflows to complete without new failures.
- **FR-004**: While remediation is in progress ahead of final release approval, publish mitigation summaries for any high- or moderate-severity vulnerabilities that remain open, noting compensating controls and review cadence.
- **FR-005**: Configure release gating criteria so that deployments are blocked whenever a high- or moderate-severity dependency vulnerability lacks proof of remediation completion.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Dependency Vulnerability**: Represents a finding from automated scans; attributes include package, version, severity, fix availability, detection date, and source workflow.
- **Remediation Record**: Captures the decision and ownership for addressing a vulnerability; attributes include linked vulnerability, remediation strategy, responsible owner, target date, status, and notes on compensating controls.

## Assumptions

- Dependency contract drift warnings between frontend and backend job models are addressed separately unless they directly block dependency remediation.
- Security review board exists to approve mitigation records and accepts digitally stored documentation.
- Automated workflows referenced in this specification remain available for validation throughout the hardening effort.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-30

- Q: How should moderate-severity dependency vulnerabilities impact release gating decisions? → A: Moderate vulnerabilities must be resolved before any release can proceed.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Dependency scans on the main branch report zero unmitigated high-severity vulnerabilities for two consecutive runs.
- **SC-002**: 100% of moderate-severity vulnerabilities have documented remediation paths with target timelines within two business days of detection.
- **SC-003**: Post-remediation builds achieve a 100% pass rate across automated unit, integration, contract, and security workflows.
- **SC-004**: Dependency-related security summaries presented to release stakeholders show zero outstanding high- or moderate-severity vulnerabilities at the time of approval.
