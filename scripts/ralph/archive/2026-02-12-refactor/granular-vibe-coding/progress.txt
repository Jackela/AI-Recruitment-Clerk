# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- The codebase uses `validateEnv()` from `@ai-recruitment-clerk/configuration` for environment variable validation
- CORS is configured in both main.ts (via allowedOrigins array) and .env (via CORS_ORIGIN string)
- Security headers middleware handles CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
- Production security validator (`ProductionSecurityValidator`) checks configuration at startup
- `.env` is already gitignored (line 76-78 in .gitignore), keeping secrets out of version control
- Service layering pattern: Each service should have a single responsibility with clear separation
- Enum naming conflicts can occur when barrel exports (index.ts) export multiple enums with same name
- The facade pattern maintains backward compatibility while allowing modular structure
- When using class instances from DTOs (e.g., `new ConsentRecord()`), ensure proper type casting
- The consentMethod property type mismatch required casting due to class-transformer vs enum differences
