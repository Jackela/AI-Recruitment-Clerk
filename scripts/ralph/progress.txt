## Codebase Patterns
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any` for dynamic objects
- Schema properties use `!` assertion with @Prop({ default: ... })
- Add `public` modifier to class properties and methods
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- ESLint rules are in eslint.config.mjs
- Replace `Function` type with `(...args: unknown[]) => unknown`
- Domain aggregates and value objects need `public` modifier on factory methods (create, restore), getters, and all public methods
- Use `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` for interface methods that need backward compatibility (e.g., event bus, audit logger)
- Playwright tests: Replace `waitForTimeout()` with proper waiting strategies like `expect().toBeVisible()` or `page.waitForLoadState()`
- Playwright tests: Replace `waitForSelector()` with locator-based waiting using `page.locator().waitFor()`
- Playwright tests: Replace `networkidle` with `domcontentloaded` or `load` wait states
- Playwright tests: Replace conditionals in tests with proper test structure or `test.skip()` for conditional skip
- Playwright tests: Replace conditional expects with proper assertions using `toBeVisible()`, `toHaveCount()`, etc.
