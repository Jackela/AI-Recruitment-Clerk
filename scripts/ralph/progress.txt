## Codebase Patterns
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any` for dynamic objects
- Schema properties use `!` assertion with @Prop({ default: ... })
- Add `public` modifier to class properties and methods
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- ESLint rules are in eslint.config.mjs
- Replace `Function` type with `(...args: unknown[]) => unknown`
- CRITICAL: Main branch has pre-existing typecheck errors - these must be fixed before quality checks can pass

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added public accessibility modifiers to all static methods in ContractValidator class
- Files changed: libs/api-contracts/src/validation/contract.validator.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The api-contracts library only needs 4 method accessibility fixes
  - Static methods need `public static` not just `static`
  - Typecheck passes after these fixes
