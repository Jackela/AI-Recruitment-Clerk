## Codebase Patterns
- Use `jest --config jest.config.cjs --passWithNoTests` for unit tests
- Use `jest --config jest.smoke.config.cjs` for smoke tests
- Use `npx nx` for monorepo operations (lint, build)
- Use `tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.ci.json` for type checking
- E2E tests require dev server running on localhost:4202 (expect failures if not running)
- Jest open handles warning is expected - all tests pass but process doesn't exit cleanly
- Console errors in domain service tests are EXPECTED error path tests

## [2026-02-03 20:45] - US-001, US-002, US-003
- Re-verified all local quality gates - all passing
- Documented non-fatal warnings in US-001-quality-gates-summary.md
- Reviewed workflow changes - all existing workflows are applicable

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- All quality gates pass consistently: lint (23 projects), typecheck, build, test (1796 tests), smoke, contracts
- E2E tests fail when dev server not running - this is expected behavior
- Jest "did not exit" warning is non-fatal - all tests pass
- Console errors in tests are intentional (testing error paths)
- The branch already contains changes from US-006 through US-018
- New files added: docs/, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, SUPPORT.md, .github workflows
