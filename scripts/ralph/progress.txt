## [2026-02-05] - US-001
- Updated ci:local script to include test:coverage and audit (mirroring GitHub Actions CI workflow)
- Added ci:full script that includes E2E tests and all quality gates
- Verified coverage/coverage-summary.json is generated after test:coverage (Jest config includes json-summary reporter)
- Added comprehensive CI documentation to scripts/ralph/CLAUDE.md with comparison table
- Files changed:
  - package.json (updated ci:local and added ci:full scripts)
  - scripts/ralph/CLAUDE.md (added CI Scripts section)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project uses Jest with `coverageReporters: ['json-summary', 'json', 'lcov', 'text']` which generates coverage-summary.json
  - GitHub Actions CI workflow runs: lint, typecheck, build, test_coverage, e2e_smoke, pii_scan
  - Separate security workflow runs: codeql, dependency-scan, secret-scan
  - Local ci:local runs: lint, typecheck, test:coverage, audit, build (matches core CI checks)
  - Local ci:full runs: ci:local + E2E tests (complete CI verification)
  - The npm audit is available via `npm run audit` which uses `nx audit`
  - Quality gates are enforced via tools/ci/verify-quality-gates.mjs with config from config/quality-gates.json
  - Current quality gate threshold is 85% coverage (config/quality-gates.json)
  - E2E tests use Playwright and can be slow; consider running them separately

## [2026-02-05] - US-002
- Added comprehensive tests for pull-to-refresh.directive.ts
- Created tests for touch gesture handling (handleTouchStart, handleTouchMove, handleTouchEnd, handleTouchCancel)
- Created tests for refresh state management (setIndicatorVisibility, resetPullState, triggerRefresh)
- Created tests for onDestroy lifecycle and event listener cleanup
- Created tests for helper methods (findTouchByIdentifier, touchExistsInList)
- Created tests for complete pull-to-refresh flow cycles
- All 39 tests passing, coverage well above 80%
- Files changed:
  - apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/directives/pull-to-refresh.directive.spec.ts (created, 627 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The pull-to-refresh directive uses Angular's inject() function which requires proper injection context
  - jsdom doesn't support Touch API - need to create mock Touch and TouchEvent objects for testing
  - Use TestBed.createComponent() to create proper Angular injection context for directives
  - Test patterns: use bracket notation ['privateMethod'] to test private methods in TypeScript
  - The directive uses document-level event listeners (touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel)
  - navigator.vibrate is mocked for testing since jsdom doesn't support it
  - The directive has a destroyRef.onDestroy callback that cleans up event listeners
  - Testing horizontal/vertical gesture thresholds requires careful coordinate calculations
  - Indicator visibility only emits when state changes (not on every call)

## [2026-02-05] - US-003
- Added comprehensive tests for date-parser.ts
- Created tests for parseDate function covering all supported date formats:
  - ISO 8601 formats (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY)
  - US formats (MM/DD/YYYY, MM/YYYY)
  - European formats (DD.MM.YYYY, MM.YYYY)
  - Text-based months (full and abbreviated)
  - Quarter formats (Q# YYYY, YYYY Q#)
  - Present keywords (present, current, now, ongoing, today, till date, till now, continuing)
- Created tests for calculateDuration function
- Created tests for createDateRange function
- Created tests for normalizeToISO function
- Created tests for checkDateRangeOverlap function
- Created tests for isReasonableDate function
- Created tests for getDateBounds function
- Created tests for edge cases (empty strings, null inputs, invalid dates, whitespace handling)
- All 97 tests passing, coverage well above 80%
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/date-parser.spec.ts (created, 1000+ lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - date-parser.ts is a static class - no need to instantiate, just call DateParser.methodName()
  - The date-parser supports many international formats - ISO 8601, US (MM/DD), European (DD.MM), text months, quarters
  - Present keywords use isPresent: true flag - important for calculating duration to current date
  - The 1950-currentYear+1 validation only applies to JavaScript fallback parsing, not pattern-matched dates
  - Use isReasonableDate() separately to validate if parsed dates are within acceptable range
  - Date range overlap uses inclusive bounds (start1 <= end2 && start2 <= end1)
  - The normalizeToISO function returns 'present' string for present dates, not an actual ISO date
  - Duration calculation handles "present" end dates by using new Date() at calculation time

## [2026-02-06] - US-004a
- Added comprehensive tests for calculateTotalExperience in experience-calculator.ts
- Created 28 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Single position tests (6 tests): full dates, year-month, year-only, partial months, present/current keywords
  - Multiple positions tests (6 tests): sequential, gaps, overlaps, varying durations, unsorted input, min/max/average
  - No positions/empty input tests (4 tests): null, undefined, empty array, invalid dates
  - Month/year conversion tests (7 tests): fractional years, rounding, 1 month, 11 months, year boundaries
  - Edge cases (5 tests): null dates, long duration, same month
- All tests passing, typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/experience-calculator.spec.ts (created, 519 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Month calculation can vary by 1 depending on date boundaries when using YYYY-MM format
  - Use toBeGreaterThanOrEqual/toBeLessThanOrEqual for tests that may have 1-month variance
  - ExperienceCalculator is a static class - call methods directly without instantiation
  - analyzeExperience() is the main entry point, with calculateTotalExperience being a private helper
  - Total experience calculation handles overlap detection (doesn't double count overlapping periods)
  - Present keywords (present, current, now, ongoing, today, till date, till now, continuing) use isPresent flag
  - DateRange objects contain start, end ParsedDate objects with duration calculated by DateParser

## [2026-02-06] - Ralph Script Fix (Infrastructure)
- Fixed Claude Code CLI hanging issue in ralph.sh
- Changes made:
  - Clear .claude directory before each iteration (prevents context buildup)
  - Changed message delivery from argument to stdin pipe
  - Appended /exit command to force CLI termination
- Root cause: Claude Code --print mode doesn't auto-exit after processing
- Files changed:
  - scripts/ralph/ralph.sh
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CLI tools invoked via command substitution $() must explicitly exit
  - Use `echo "message" | cli` instead of `cli "message"` when termination control needed
  - /exit is a built-in Claude Code CLI command for clean shutdown
  - Clearing .claude prevents context compression artifacts across iterations

## [2026-02-06] - US-004b
- Added comprehensive tests for overlap detection (detectOverlappingPositions) in experience-calculator.ts
- Created 22 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Overlapping positions with same dates (5 tests): identical dates, start during another, end during another, present end date, both present
  - Non-overlapping and boundary-adjacent positions (4 tests): sequential with boundary, gaps, clear separation, single position
  - Partial overlap scenarios (5 tests): start overlap, end overlap, containment, multiple overlapping, complex chain
  - Edge cases with null dates (5 tests): null start, null end, both null, invalid format, present keyword handling
  - Different date formats (3 tests): year-month, year-only, mixed formats
- All 50 tests passing (28 existing + 22 new), typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/experience-calculator.spec.ts (extended with 22 new tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `checkDateRangeOverlap` function uses inclusive bounds: `start1 <= end2 && start2 <= end1`
  - This means boundary-adjacent positions (e.g., A ends 2020-01-01, B starts 2020-01-01) are considered overlapping
  - The overlap detection compares each position pair (nested loop), adding both to the result when overlap detected
  - "present" keyword is handled by using `new Date()` for the end date during comparison
  - Positions with null dates are filtered out before overlap detection (return 0 overlaps)
  - The test helper function `createWorkExperience` uses inferred types - remove explicit type annotation for default parameters
