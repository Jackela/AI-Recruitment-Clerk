## 2026-02-04 - US-001
- Created `docs/TECH_DEBT_REGISTER.md` with 20 technical debt items
- Each item includes impact level, owner, description, and suggested fix
- Items categorized by priority: 6 High, 12 Medium, 2 Low
- Typecheck passes
- Committed: feat: US-001 - Create tech-debt register

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The codebase has significant technical debt around TypeScript `any` types (164+ files)
- Large files over 500 lines are widespread, particularly `mobile-dashboard.component.ts` (~1208 lines)
- Inconsistent error handling across 239+ files
- Domain model duplication between libs/shared-dtos and domain libraries
- TODO comments scattered across 97+ files should be tracked as tickets
- Hard-coded configuration values in 190+ files need centralization via libs/configuration
- Logging patterns are inconsistent (console.log vs structured logging)
