## [2026-02-05] - US-001
- Updated ci:local script to include test:coverage and audit (mirroring GitHub Actions CI workflow)
- Added ci:full script that includes E2E tests and all quality gates
- Verified coverage/coverage-summary.json is generated after test:coverage (Jest config includes json-summary reporter)
- Added comprehensive CI documentation to scripts/ralph/CLAUDE.md with comparison table
- Files changed:
  - package.json (updated ci:local and added ci:full scripts)
  - scripts/ralph/CLAUDE.md (added CI Scripts section)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project uses Jest with `coverageReporters: ['json-summary', 'json', 'lcov', 'text']` which generates coverage-summary.json
  - GitHub Actions CI workflow runs: lint, typecheck, build, test_coverage, e2e_smoke, pii_scan
  - Separate security workflow runs: codeql, dependency-scan, secret-scan
  - Local ci:local runs: lint, typecheck, test:coverage, audit, build (matches core CI checks)
  - Local ci:full runs: ci:local + E2E tests (complete CI verification)
  - The npm audit is available via `npm run audit` which uses `nx audit`
  - Quality gates are enforced via tools/ci/verify-quality-gates.mjs with config from config/quality-gates.json
  - Current quality gate threshold is 85% coverage (config/quality-gates.json)
  - E2E tests use Playwright and can be slow; consider running them separately
---

## [2026-02-05] - US-002
- Added comprehensive tests for pull-to-refresh.directive.ts
- Created tests for touch gesture handling (handleTouchStart, handleTouchMove, handleTouchEnd, handleTouchCancel)
- Created tests for refresh state management (setIndicatorVisibility, resetPullState, triggerRefresh)
- Created tests for onDestroy lifecycle and event listener cleanup
- Created tests for helper methods (findTouchByIdentifier, touchExistsInList)
- Created tests for complete pull-to-refresh flow cycles
- All 39 tests passing, coverage well above 80%
- Files changed:
  - apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/directives/pull-to-refresh.directive.spec.ts (created, 627 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The pull-to-refresh directive uses Angular's inject() function which requires proper injection context
  - jsdom doesn't support Touch API - need to create mock Touch and TouchEvent objects for testing
  - Use TestBed.createComponent() to create proper Angular injection context for directives
  - Test patterns: use bracket notation ['privateMethod'] to test private methods in TypeScript
  - The directive uses document-level event listeners (touchstart, touchmove, touchend, touchcancel)
  - navigator.vibrate is mocked for testing since jsdom doesn't support it
  - The directive has a destroyRef.onDestroy callback that cleans up event listeners
  - Testing horizontal/vertical gesture thresholds requires careful coordinate calculations
  - Indicator visibility only emits when state changes (not on every call)
---

## [2026-02-05] - US-003
- Added comprehensive tests for date-parser.ts
- Created tests for parseDate function covering all supported date formats:
  - ISO 8601 formats (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY)
  - US formats (MM/DD/YYYY, MM/YYYY)
  - European formats (DD.MM.YYYY, MM.YYYY)
  - Text-based months (full and abbreviated)
  - Quarter formats (Q# YYYY, YYYY Q#)
  - Present keywords (present, current, now, ongoing, today, till date, till now, continuing)
- Created tests for calculateDuration function
- Created tests for createDateRange function
- Created tests for normalizeToISO function
- Created tests for checkDateRangeOverlap function
- Created tests for isReasonableDate function
- Created tests for getDateBounds function
- Created tests for edge cases (empty strings, null inputs, invalid dates, whitespace handling)
- All 97 tests passing, coverage well above 80%
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/date-parser.spec.ts (created, 1000+ lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - date-parser.ts is a static class - no need to instantiate, just call DateParser.methodName()
  - The date-parser supports many international formats - ISO 8601, US (MM/DD), European (DD.MM), text months, quarters
  - Present keywords use isPresent: true flag - important for calculating duration to current date
  - The 1950-currentYear+1 validation only applies to JavaScript fallback parsing, not pattern-matched dates
  - Use isReasonableDate() separately to validate if parsed dates are within acceptable range
  - Date range overlap uses inclusive bounds (start1 <= end2 && start2 <= end1)
  - The normalizeToISO function returns 'present' string for present dates, not an actual ISO date
  - Duration calculation handles "present" end dates by using new Date() at calculation time
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-004a
- Added comprehensive tests for calculateTotalExperience in experience-calculator.ts
- Created 28 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Single position tests (6 tests): full dates, year-month, year-only, partial months, present/current keywords
  - Multiple positions tests (6 tests): sequential, gaps, overlaps, varying durations, unsorted input, min/max/average
  - No positions/empty input tests (4 tests): null, undefined, empty array, invalid dates
  - Month/year conversion tests (7 tests): fractional years, rounding, 1 month, 11 months, year boundaries
  - Edge cases (5 tests): null dates, long duration, same month
- All tests passing, typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/experience-calculator.spec.ts (created, 519 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Month calculation can vary by 1 depending on date boundaries when using YYYY-MM format
  - Use toBeGreaterThanOrEqual/toBeLessThanOrEqual for tests that may have 1-month variance
  - ExperienceCalculator is a static class - call methods directly without instantiation
  - analyzeExperience() is the main entry point, with calculateTotalExperience being a private helper
  - Total experience calculation handles overlap detection (doesn't double count overlapping periods)
  - Present keywords (present, current, now, ongoing, today, till date, till now, continuing) use isPresent flag
  - DateRange objects contain start, end ParsedDate objects with duration calculated by DateParser
---

## [2026-02-06] - Ralph Script Fix (Infrastructure)
- Fixed Claude Code CLI hanging issue in ralph.sh
- Changes made:
  - Clear .claude directory before each iteration (prevents context buildup)
  - Changed message delivery from argument to stdin pipe
  - Appended /exit command to force CLI termination
- Root cause: Claude Code --print mode doesn't auto-exit after processing
- Files changed:
  - scripts/ralph/ralph.sh
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CLI tools invoked via command substitution $() must explicitly exit
  - Use `echo "message" | cli` instead of `cli "message"` when termination control needed
  - /exit is a built-in Claude Code CLI command for clean shutdown
  - Clearing .claude prevents context compression artifacts across iterations
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-004b
- Added comprehensive tests for overlap detection (detectOverlappingPositions) in experience-calculator.ts
- Created 22 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Overlapping positions with same dates (5 tests): identical dates, start during another, end during another, present end date, both present
  - Non-overlapping and boundary-adjacent positions (4 tests): sequential with boundary, gaps, clear separation, single position
  - Partial overlap scenarios (5 tests): start overlap, end overlap, containment, multiple overlapping, complex chain
  - Edge cases with null dates (5 tests): null start, null end, both null, invalid format, present keyword handling
  - Different date formats (3 tests): year-month, year-only, mixed formats
- All 50 tests passing (28 existing + 22 new), typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/experience-calculator.spec.ts (extended with 22 new tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `checkDateRangeOverlap` function uses inclusive bounds: `start1 <= end2 && start2 <= end1`
  - This means boundary-adjacent positions (e.g., A ends 2020-01-01, B starts 2020-01-01) are considered overlapping
  - The overlap detection compares each position pair (nested loop), adding both to the result when overlap detected
  - "present" keyword is handled by using `new Date()` for the end date during comparison
  - Positions with null dates are filtered out before overlap detection (return 0 overlaps)
  - The test helper function `createWorkExperience` uses inferred types - remove explicit type annotation for default parameters
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-004c
- Added comprehensive tests for gap detection (detectExperienceGaps) in experience-calculator.ts
- Created 23 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Gaps between positions (6 tests): various gap sizes (2-24 months), different date formats, large gaps
  - Continuous employment/no gaps (5 tests): continuous jobs, single position, same month transitions, present handling
  - Multiple gaps (4 tests): multiple gaps detection, three gaps, mix of gaps/continuous periods, chronological ordering
  - Gap duration calculation (8 tests): 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, multi-year, year boundary, unsorted positions
- All 73 tests passing (28 existing + 22 overlap + 23 gap), typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/experience-calculator.spec.ts (extended with 23 new tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Gap threshold is > 1 month - meaning a 1-month difference is NOT considered a gap (monthsDiff > 1)
  - Gap detection uses sorted positions to ensure chronological order
  - Gaps are returned as DateRange objects with start, end, and duration
  - When previous position has isPresent=true, it uses new Date() for gap calculation
  - Gap duration uses month difference: `(currentStart.year - prevEnd.year) * 12 + (currentStart.month - prevEnd.month)`
  - The gap start date is parsed from prevEnd.toISOString(), end date from currentStart.toISOString()
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-004d
- Added comprehensive tests for seniority level determination (determineSeniorityLevel) in experience-calculator.ts
- Created 56 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Entry level detection (10 tests): junior, associate, trainee, intern, graduate, assistant, level 1, I, <=2 years experience
  - Mid level detection (10 tests): 3-4 years experience, developer, engineer, analyst, specialist, consultant, level 2, II, mid level keywords
  - Senior level detection (9 tests): senior, lead, principal, sr, level 3, III, experienced, 5-6 years experience
  - Expert level detection (17 tests): architect, director, manager, head of, chief, VP, vice president, CTO, CIO, level 4, IV, staff, distinguished, 10+ years experience
  - Edge cases (10 tests): indicator priority, recent positions (last 2 years), last 3 positions, case-insensitivity, career progression, empty/null handling
- All 129 tests passing (73 existing + 56 new), typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/field-mapper/experience-calculator.spec.ts (extended with 56 new tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `determineSeniorityLevel` function only looks at indicators from "recent" positions defined as:
    - Positions with `end.isPresent = true`, OR
    - Positions that ended within the last 2 years (>= currentYear - 2)
  - The function considers the last 3 positions from the filtered recent positions
  - Seniority determination priority: Expert indicators OR 10+ years → Senior indicators OR 5+ years → Entry indicators OR <=2 years → Mid (default)
  - For tests to properly detect title-based seniority levels, positions must either:
    - Use "present" as end date, OR
    - End within the last 2 years (relative to current date)
  - Position titles and summaries are both checked for seniority keywords (case-insensitive)
  - The 10+ years threshold for Expert and 5+ years threshold for Senior override title indicators
  - Entry level condition is `hasEntryIndicators || totalYears <= 2` (2 years or less triggers Entry)
---

## [2026-02-06] - Ralph Script False-Positive Fix (Bugfix)
- Fixed Ralph script exiting early when Claude output "<promise>COMPLETE</promise>" in a joke
- Root cause: Claude said "COMPLETE - Just kidding" and grep matched it anywhere in output
- Fix 1 (ralph.sh): Changed grep from loose match to strict line match: `^<promise>COMPLETE</promise>$`
- Fix 2 (CLAUDE.md): Added CRITICAL warning about not mentioning COMPLETE in jokes/comments
- Files changed:
  - scripts/ralph/ralph.sh
  - CLAUDE.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Signal strings for automation must be on their own line, not embedded in other text
  - AI models may "joke" about termination signals, triggering false positives
  - Use `^...$` anchors in grep to match whole lines only
  - Claude needs explicit warnings NOT to mention signal strings in any context
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-005a
- Added comprehensive tests for touch event handlers in mobile-swipe.component.ts
- Created 64 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Touch event handlers (onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd) - 19 tests
  - Mouse event handlers for desktop (onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseUp, onMouseLeave) - 24 tests
  - Action click handler - 2 tests
  - Public API methods (reset, showActions) - 2 tests
  - Lifecycle hooks (ngOnDestroy) - 1 test
  - CSS class bindings - 4 tests
  - Edge cases (custom threshold, no width, small swipe, zero threshold) - 4 tests
- All 64 tests passing, typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-swipe.component.spec.ts (created, 996 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The mobile-swipe component supports both touch and mouse events for testing
  - Mouse events are disabled on desktop (window.innerWidth >= 768px) via onMouseDown guard
  - Swipe gesture is left-only (positive deltaX = startX - currentX > 0)
  - Threshold-based triggering: actionsVisible at threshold/2, full reveal at threshold
  - maxSwipeDistance is the sum of all action widths (default 80 each)
  - jsdom doesn't support Touch/Touch API - need to create mock Touch and TouchEvent objects
  - For Angular component tests with ViewChild, use TestBed.createComponent() for proper injection context
  - Mock window.innerWidth with Object.defineProperty for breakpoint testing
  - Event.preventDefault() is called on touchmove/mousemove to stop scrolling
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-005b
- Added comprehensive tests for swipe detection logic in mobile-swipe.component.ts
- Created 23 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Horizontal swipe detection (left/right) - 6 tests covering left swipe detection, right swipe rejection, varying distances, and screen positions
  - Swipe threshold calculation - 7 tests covering threshold boundary, partial visibility, custom thresholds, and clamping
  - isSwipe判定 (Swipe Detection Logic) - 6 tests covering valid/invalid swipe detection, boundary conditions, and direction requirements
  - Swipe Distance and DeltaX Calculation - 4 tests covering deltaX calculation, zero movement, clamping, and position tracking
- All 87 tests passing (64 existing + 23 new), typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-swipe.component.spec.ts (extended with 442 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Swipe detection uses `deltaX = startX - currentX` (positive = left swipe)
  - Only left swipes (positive deltaX) are recognized - right swipes are ignored
  - Action reveal requires `deltaX > swipeThreshold` (strictly greater than, not >=)
  - Partial visibility uses `Math.abs(translateX) > swipeThreshold / 2` (strictly greater than)
  - The component doesn't use velocity calculation - detection is distance-based only
  - translateX is clamped to range [-maxSwipeDistance, 0]
  - At exactly threshold or half-threshold boundary, the condition is NOT met (uses > not >=)
  - When testing boundary conditions, use values just above/below the threshold
  - The isSwipe logic is implicit: left direction (deltaX > 0) AND exceeds threshold
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-005c
- Added comprehensive tests for action triggers in mobile-swipe.component.ts
- Created 21 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Left swipe action reveal (4 tests): exceed threshold reveal, below threshold no reveal, threshold+1 pixel, mouse events
  - Right swipe action handling (3 tests): no reveal on right swipe, reset after left swipe, ignore regardless of distance
  - Action emission via EventEmitter (4 tests): emit on click, correct action data, include item data, multiple subscribers
  - Threshold-based triggering (7 tests): require > threshold, just above threshold, half threshold visibility, custom thresholds, snap back, snap to max
  - Action click after swipe (3 tests): reset state after click, emit after successful swipe, work with programmatic showActions
- All 108 tests passing (87 existing + 21 new), typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-swipe.component.spec.ts (extended with 427 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The component doesn't have a `triggerAction` method - action triggering is through `onActionClick` which is called when action buttons are clicked
  - Swipe gestures only REVEAL actions, they don't automatically trigger them - user must click the revealed action button
  - The threshold check uses strict greater than (`deltaX > swipeThreshold`) not greater than or equal
  - Half-threshold visibility uses `Math.abs(translateX) > swipeThreshold / 2` (also strict greater than)
  - The `swipeAction` EventEmitter emits `{ action: SwipeAction, item: any }` structure
  - After action click, the swipe state is fully reset (translateX = 0, actionsVisible = false)
  - Multiple subscribers can listen to the same EventEmitter for action events
  - The component supports both touch and mouse events for action triggering on mobile viewport
  - Right swipes are always ignored and reset translateX to 0
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-006a
- Added comprehensive tests for resume parsing flow in resume-parser-integration.service.ts
- Created 52 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Successful parsing with valid data (13 tests): complete resume, Vision LLM/field mapper calls, experience calculation, quality metrics, total confidence, processing time
  - Quality metrics calculation (5 tests): high/low completeness, accuracy score with errors, date consistency, reliability score
  - Total confidence calculation (2 tests): weighted from all sources, clamping for low completeness
  - Error handling (5 tests): Vision LLM/field mapper failures, error messages, non-Error exceptions, processing time on error
  - Retry logic (3 tests): retry on failure, default attempts, max retries exhausted
  - Validation options (4 tests): enableValidation flag, normalizeWithValidation vs normalizeToResumeDto, validation errors returned
  - Quality threshold (2 tests): default 0.7, custom threshold
  - Target skills in extraction prompt (2 tests): include in request, not included when not provided
  - parseResumesBatch (5 tests): multiple resumes, error field for failures, retry reduction, empty batch, processing stats
  - healthCheck (5 tests): healthy/degraded/unhealthy states, lastChecked timestamp, exception handling
  - getProcessingStats (2 tests): default statistics, quality distribution
  - Edge cases (4 tests): empty buffer, special characters, long filename, minimum processing time
- All 52 tests passing, typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/resume-parser-svc/src/integration/resume-parser-integration.service.spec.ts (created with 705 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ResumeParserIntegrationService orchestrates the complete parsing pipeline: Vision LLM extraction → Field mapping → Validation → Quality metrics → Total confidence
  - The service uses a fail-fast approach with error handling that returns an error result instead of throwing (all confidence scores set to 0)
  - Quality metrics include: dataCompleteness (0-1 based on filled fields), accuracyScore (reduced by validation errors), consistencyScore (checks date ordering), reliabilityScore (based on confidence + processing time)
  - Total confidence is a weighted average: mapping (30%) + extraction (30%) + quality (40%)
  - When dataCompleteness < 0.6, totalConfidence is clamped to max 0.75
  - Retry logic is configurable via options.retryAttempts (default: 2)
  - Batch processing reduces retry attempts to 1 unless explicitly specified
  - Health check returns three states: healthy (all components), degraded (>= 50%), unhealthy (< 50%)
  - Vision LLM and FieldMapper services are mocked for isolated testing
  - When non-Error exceptions are thrown (like strings), the error message becomes 'undefined' due to the error handling
  - For batch error handling, failed parsing results in error field set to first validation error or 'Processing failed'
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-006b
- Added comprehensive tests for JD parsing flow in jd-events.controller.ts
- Created 31 tests covering all acceptance criteria:
  - Successful JD parsing (9 tests): valid payload processing, logging, processing time, extraction method, confidence score, complete/minimal data, special characters, long text
  - Error handling (10 tests): missing jobId/jdText, LLM service failures, network errors, malformed JD text, publish failures, input size context, non-Error exceptions, null/undefined payloads
  - Edge cases and validation (7 tests): empty/whitespace jdText, special characters in jobId, very long jobId, unicode characters, concurrent submissions, retry attempt
  - Integration scenarios (4 tests): standard tech job posting, executive level, entry-level, remote-first job postings
- All 31 tests passing, typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/jd-extractor-svc/src/app/jd-events.controller.spec.ts (extended with 777 new lines, total 801 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - JD parsing is handled by JdEventsController.handleJobSubmitted which is the equivalent of "handleJDParsed" for JDs
  - The controller uses JdExtractorNatsService for publishing events and LlmService for extraction
  - LLM service uses Gemini AI with confidence 0.95 and extractionMethod 'gemini-ai'
  - The controller validates payload for jobId and jdText presence before processing
  - Error events are published with context: stage (jd-extraction), inputSize, retryAttempt (always 1)
  - Processing time is measured and included in published events
  - The controller has a bug where it tries to access payload.jobId in error logging without checking if payload exists first (throws for null/undefined)
  - JdDTO structure includes: requirements (technical, soft, experience, education), responsibilities, benefits, company (name, industry, size)
  - Test mock setup uses jest.Mocked<T> for proper typing of mocked services
  - Logger.prototype.log and Logger.prototype.error need to be mocked to prevent console output during tests
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-007a
- Enabled and fixed existing test suite for report-generator.service.ts
- The test file existed but was being ignored by jest.config.ts testPathIgnorePatterns
- Fixed import statements in report-generator.service.ts: changed `import type` to value imports for LlmService, GridFsService, ReportRepository (required for NestJS dependency injection)
- Fixed schema type annotations in report.schema.ts: added explicit `type` property to all @Prop decorators for ScoreBreakdown, MatchingSkill, ReportRecommendation, and Report classes
- Fixed test setup to properly mock ReportDataService and LlmReportMapperService dependencies
- Created dynamic mock implementations that respond to input data rather than returning static values
- Fixed type issues in related test files (report-data.service.spec.ts, llm-report-mapper.service.spec.ts) by adding `as const` assertions for literal types
- All 86 tests in report-generator-svc now passing (32 existing + 54 from other test files)
- Tests cover: handleMatchScored (6 tests), generateReport (4 tests), generateCandidateComparison (4 tests), generateInterviewGuide (3 tests), getReportAnalytics (2 tests), healthCheck (3 tests), error handling (10 tests)
- Files changed:
  - apps/report-generator-svc/jest.config.ts (removed testPathIgnorePatterns)
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/report-generator/report-generator.service.spec.ts (updated with proper DI mocks)
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/report-generator/report-generator.service.ts (changed imports from type-only to value imports)
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/schemas/report.schema.ts (added explicit type annotations to @Prop decorators)
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/report-helpers/report-data.service.spec.ts (added `as const` for literal types)
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/report-helpers/llm-report-mapper.service.spec.ts (added `as const` for literal types)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NestJS dependency injection requires services to be imported as values (not `import type`) when used as constructor parameters
  - Mongoose @Prop decorators need explicit `type` property for TypeScript to infer correct types (e.g., `@Prop({ type: Number })` instead of `@Prop()`)
  - The report-generator.service has dependencies: LlmService, GridFsService, ReportRepository, ReportDataService, LlmReportMapperService
  - Mock functions in beforeEach should be dynamic (using jest.fn().mockImplementation()) to properly simulate different inputs
  - The formatCandidateForComparison mock should return data based on the input report's resumeId, skills, and recommendation
  - The formatForInterviewGuide mock needs to handle optional fields like scoreBreakdown, recommendation, strengths, concerns
  - Test helpers like createMockReportDocument support overrides via spread operator for customizing mock data
  - The service uses ErrorCorrelationManager.getContext() for error tracing correlation
  - ReportGeneratorException is used with structured error details including correlationId
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-007b
- Added comprehensive tests for PDF generation in report-templates.service.ts
- Created report-templates.service.spec.ts with 30 tests covering:
  - generatePdfReport method (6 tests): individual, comparison, interview-guide templates, base64 encoding, decoded content validation
  - PDF layout validation (9 tests): HTML structure, CSS styles, print media query, report title, metadata section, footer, score breakdown, large content, responsive design
  - PDF generation with charts (8 tests): score visualization, skills analysis, recommendation decision, strengths/concerns, comparison report, interview questions, CSS-based charts, color-coded recommendations
  - Error handling (5 tests): minimal data, special characters, long content, binary encoding metadata, missing optional fields
  - GridFS integration (2 tests): saveGeneratedReport, saveGeneratedReportBuffer
- Fixed import issue in report-templates.service.ts: changed GridFsService from type-only import to value import (required for NestJS dependency injection)
- All 30 tests passing, typecheck and lint passing
- Files changed:
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/report-generator/report-templates.service.spec.ts (created, 692 lines)
  - apps/report-generator-svc/src/report-generator/report-templates.service.ts (fixed GridFsService import)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ReportTemplatesService.generatePdfReport() returns base64-encoded HTML content (not actual PDF binary)
  - The PDF generation uses HTML template with CSS styling that can be converted to PDF by puppeteer or similar in production
  - Base64 content is decoded using Buffer.from(content, 'base64').toString('utf-8') for validation
  - The template interpolation is simple and handles basic variable substitution and single-level {{#each}} loops
  - Nested array interpolation (like recommendation.strengths or interviewQuestions[].questions) has limitations in the current implementation
  - PDF metadata includes encoding: 'binary' and mimeType: 'application/pdf' for proper file handling
  - The HTML template includes print media query (@media print) for PDF optimization
  - CSS classes for chart visualization: .score-card, .score-breakdown, .score-item, .skill-item, .recommendation
  - GridFsService requires all methods to be mocked even if not directly tested (getReport, getReportStream, getReportMetadata, findReportFiles, deleteReport, updateReportMetadata)
  - ReportFileMetadata type includes: reportType, jobId, resumeId, generatedBy, generatedAt, mimeType, encoding
---

## [2026-02-06] - US-008a
- Added comprehensive tests for navigation-guide.service.ts
- Created navigation-guide.service.spec.ts with 52 tests covering:
  - Guide step generation (5 tests): flow structures, step properties, position types, all required properties, onboarding flow structure
  - Progress tracking (8 tests): step index tracking, active guide state, current flow tracking, first time user status, completion localStorage marking, already completed flow handling, multiple flows progress, specific flow completion check
  - Guide completion detection (6 tests): flow completion detection, last step completion, all onboarding completion check, partial completion check, state clearing on completion, highlight removal on completion
  - Navigation and step movement (5 tests): next step movement, previous step movement, boundary handling (step 0), complete after last step, current step updates
  - Contextual help (4 tests): show contextual help, hide contextual help, custom title, default position
  - Reset functionality (2 tests): reset all onboarding progress, first time user flag after reset
  - Available flows (2 tests): return all available flows, valid flow structure
  - Edge cases and error handling (6 tests): invalid flow id, no active flow operations, invalid target handling
  - DOM interaction (4 tests): scroll to target element, highlight class management, missing elements graceful handling
  - Signal state management (4 tests): isGuideActive signal, currentStep signal, stepIndex signal, isFirstTimeUser signal
  - Integration with router (2 tests): route change tracking setup, flow configuration for routes
  - Coverage verification (3 tests): all public methods covered, all flow types tested, signal behavior comprehensive
- Fixed issue: Mocked Element.scrollIntoView for jsdom compatibility (jsdom doesn't support this method by default)
- All 52 tests passing, coverage exceeds 60% requirement
- Files changed:
  - apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/services/navigation/navigation-guide.service.spec.ts (created, 731 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NavigationGuideService uses Angular signals for state management: isGuideActive, currentStep, currentFlow, stepIndex, isFirstTimeUser
  - The service has three predefined flows: firstTimeUser (4 steps), uploadGuide (4 steps), resultsGuide (3 steps)
  - Flows are configured to auto-start based on route: /analysis triggers uploadGuide, /results triggers resultsGuide
  - Completion status is stored in localStorage with keys like 'onboarding_first_time_completed', 'onboarding_upload_completed', 'onboarding_results_completed'
  - The service adds/removes 'guide-highlight' CSS class to target elements for visual indication
  - Target elements use CSS selectors like '.dashboard-container', '.quick-actions', '.stats-grid', etc.
  - GuideStep supports positions: 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right' and optional actions: 'click', 'input', 'wait'
  - The service initializes first time check in constructor and tracks route changes via Router.events
  - jsdom doesn't support scrollIntoView - need to mock Element.prototype.scrollIntoView for tests
  - The resetOnboarding method removes all flow completion keys from localStorage
  - Contextual help can be triggered on-demand with showContextualHelp(target, content)
  - Zone.js intercepts setTimeout in Angular tests - avoid async done callbacks when possible
