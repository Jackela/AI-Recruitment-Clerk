## 2026-02-04 - US-001
- Created docs/ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md with architectural layers and dependency rules
- Documented module boundary tags (type:app, scope:shared, scope:domain, layer:contracts, type:utils)
- Added ASCII diagram showing layer hierarchy and data flow
- Defined DDD structure for domain libraries (domain/application/infrastructure)
- Documented service base class pattern and NATS microservice conventions
- Files changed: docs/ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md (new)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The project uses ESLint `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` for dependency rules - check eslint.config.mjs for current tag definitions
- Domain libraries follow DDD structure with /domain (entities, VOs, events), /application (commands, queries, handlers), /infrastructure (persistence, messaging, APIs)
- All NATS microservices extend BaseMicroserviceService from @ai-recruitment-clerk/service-base
- Environment validation uses @ai-recruitment-clerk/configuration
- Shared libs (scope:shared) can only depend on other shared libs or type:utils
- Domain libs (scope:domain) can depend on shared, utils, contracts, and other domains
