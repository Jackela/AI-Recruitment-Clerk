## Codebase Patterns
- Use `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/pipes/` for shared NestJS pipes
- Export new utilities from both their folder index and the main lib index
- Use `InternalDtoValidationPipeOptions` pattern to avoid Required<> type issues with optional fields
- Microservices: Register global pipes via APP_PIPE provider token in app.module.ts
- HTTP Gateways: Register global pipes via app.useGlobalPipes() in main.ts

## [2026-02-04] - US-001
- Introduced shared DTO validation pipe in libs/infrastructure-shared
- Created `DtoValidationPipe` class using class-validator and class-transformer
- Added factory function `createDtoValidationPipe` for convenient instantiation
- Exported from infrastructure-shared index for cross-service usage
- Files changed:
  - `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/pipes/dto-validation.pipe.ts` (new)
  - `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/pipes/index.ts` (new)
  - `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/index.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: When creating options interfaces, separate internal required options from public optional options to avoid TypeScript Required<> type issues
  - The app-gateway already has a `CustomValidationPipe` that can be migrated to the shared pipe in future stories (US-002)
  - Typecheck with tsconfig.ci.json is the project's verification standard
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-002
- Replaced NestJS built-in ValidationPipe with shared DtoValidationPipe in app-gateway
- Updated imports in main.ts to use createDtoValidationPipe from infrastructure-shared
- Configured pipe with whitelist=true, transform=true, forbidNonWhitelisted=true
- Files changed:
  - `apps/app-gateway/src/main.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - app-gateway was using NestJS's built-in ValidationPipe directly, not a CustomValidationPipe
  - The shared pipe is exported from infrastructure-shared via the pipes index
  - Replacing the built-in pipe is straightforward - just swap the import and factory call
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-003
- Registered shared DtoValidationPipe globally in resume-parser-svc
- Used APP_PIPE provider token in app.module.ts (microservice pattern)
- Added import for createDtoValidationPipe from infrastructure-shared
- Files changed:
  - `apps/resume-parser-svc/src/app/app.module.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: Microservices use APP_PIPE provider token in app.module.ts, whereas HTTP gateways use app.useGlobalPipes() in main.ts
  - The infrastructure-shared library exports both createDtoValidationPipe and its types
  - Import APP_PIPE alongside APP_FILTER and APP_INTERCEPTOR from @nestjs/core
  - Use useFactory with createDtoValidationPipe() for clean instantiation
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-004
- Created shared API error response DTO in libs/shared-dtos
- Defined interfaces: ErrorResponse, ErrorResponseContext, ErrorCorrelation, ErrorRecovery, ErrorImpact, ErrorMonitoring
- Exported ErrorResponseDto and MinimalErrorResponseDto from shared-dtos index
- Files changed:
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/error-response.dto.ts` (new)
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/index.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Naming conflict: `ErrorContext` is already used as a decorator in error-handling.decorators.ts, so renamed to `ErrorResponseContext`
  - The existing `StandardizedErrorResponse` in error-response-formatter.ts has similar structure - this DTO provides the canonical typed interface
  - Pattern: DTO files should be at the lib root (e.g., error-response.dto.ts) for discoverability, then grouped in subfolders in later refactor stories (US-015/US-016)
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-005
- Aligned error-response-formatter.ts to use shared ErrorResponseDto from error-response.dto.ts
- Deprecated StandardizedErrorResponse interface as an alias to ErrorResponseDto
- Imported and re-exported all related types from error-response.dto.ts
- Updated formatEnhanced method to return ErrorResponseDto type
- Files changed:
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/errors/error-response-formatter.ts` (updated)
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json` (updated)
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The global-exception.filter.ts in app-gateway re-exports from shared-dtos, so updating error-response-formatter.ts automatically propagates the changes
  - Pattern: When consolidating types, use type alias with @deprecated comment for backward compatibility (e.g., `export type StandardizedErrorResponse = ErrorResponseDto`)
  - This allows gradual migration while maintaining existing code that uses the old type name
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-006, US-007
- Audited all NATS services for BaseMicroserviceService usage
- Created docs/NATS_BASE_CLASS_AUDIT.md with comprehensive audit results
- Found all 4 NATS services already extend BaseMicroserviceService (resume-parser-svc, jd-extractor-svc, scoring-engine-svc, report-generator-svc)
- Marked US-007 as passing since no refactoring is needed
- Files changed:
  - `docs/NATS_BASE_CLASS_AUDIT.md` (new)
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All NATS services follow the same pattern: extend BaseMicroserviceService, inject ConfigService/NatsConnectionManager/NatsStreamManager
  - Each service uses protected methods: publishEvent(), publishErrorEvent(), subscribeToEvents()
  - Service names are passed as string to super() constructor: 'resume-parser-svc', 'jd-extractor-svc', 'scoring-engine-svc', 'report-generator-svc'
  - NATS service files are located in apps/{service}/src/services/{service}-nats.service.ts
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-008
- Expanded appGateway schema in libs/configuration with all env vars used by the service
- Updated main.ts to use validateEnv('appGateway') for type-safe config access
- Added getNodeEnv() helper in app.module.ts for centralized environment access
- Replaced direct process.env usage in main.ts bootstrap logic with env validator methods
- Files changed:
  - `libs/configuration/src/env-validator/env-validator.util.ts` (updated)
  - `apps/app-gateway/src/main.ts` (updated)
  - `apps/app-gateway/src/app/app.module.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern: validateEnv() returns EnvAccess with methods like getString(), getNumber(), getBoolean(), getArray()
  - Module-level config (before NestJS bootstrap) still needs process.env for NODE_ENV detection
  - Add all env vars to ServiceSchemas to enable type-safe access via the validator
  - Module-level isTestEnv checks use a helper function instead of direct process.env access
  - validateEnv() throws if required env vars are missing - enforces fail-fast architecture
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-009
- Expanded resumeParser schema with MongoDB URL aliases and other env vars
- Added getMongoUrl() helper in app.module.ts for centralized environment access
- Replaced inline process.env fallback chain with helper function
- Files changed:
  - `libs/configuration/src/env-validator/env-validator.util.ts` (updated)
  - `apps/resume-parser-svc/src/app/app.module.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MongoDB URL has multiple aliases: MONGODB_URL, MONGO_URL, MONGODB_URI (for test compatibility)
  - Microservices use helper functions at module level since they don't have a main.ts bootstrap
  - Helper function pattern (getMongoUrl) centralizes env access and maintains fail-fast behavior
  - Keep test env vars (USE_DOCKER, JEST_FORCE_EXIT) in schema for documentation even if not used in main code
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-010
- Created docs/REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md with comprehensive refactoring checklist
- Included pre-refactor, during refactor, and verification steps
- Added quick reference for project commands and common patterns
- Files changed:
  - `docs/REFACTOR_CHECKLIST.md` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Checklist emphasizes TDD: write tests first, then refactor
  - Verification includes: typecheck, lint, test, build, e2e, contracts
  - Links to key documentation files (CLAUDE.md, progress.txt, NATS audit)
  - Reminds about fail-fast architecture and ESM compatibility
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-011
- Consolidated Jest setup files to use shared jest.setup.ts from jest.preset.cjs
- Moved instanceof matcher patch from jd-extractor-svc/jest.setup.ts to shared jest.setup.ts
- Removed jd-extractor-svc/jest.setup.ts override, now uses shared setup via jest.preset.cjs
- Simplified resume-parser-svc/jest.setup.ts to only contain service-specific mocks (pdf-parse-fork, shared-dtos)
- Removed unused setup-jest.ts file (no references in codebase)
- Files changed:
  - `jest.setup.ts` (updated - added instanceof matcher patch)
  - `apps/jd-extractor-svc/jest.config.ts` (updated - removed setupFilesAfterEnv override)
  - `apps/jd-extractor-svc/jest.setup.ts` (deleted)
  - `apps/resume-parser-svc/jest.setup.ts` (simplified - service-specific mocks only)
  - `setup-jest.ts` (deleted - unused)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Jest preset pattern: jest.preset.cjs specifies `setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/../../jest.setup.ts']` for shared setup
  - Individual apps can override by specifying their own `setupFilesAfterEnv` in jest.config.ts (REPLACES, not extends)
  - Service-specific mocks (like pdf-parse-fork for resume-parser-svc) should stay in service-level jest.setup.ts
  - The shared jest.setup.ts now includes: cleanup registry, NestJS logger silencing, process warning filtering, handle detection, instanceof matcher patch
  - Test results: jd-extractor-svc (131 passed), resume-parser-svc (153 passed, 2 pre-existing failures)

## [2026-02-04] - US-012
- Verified all config folder references use correct /config paths
- Searched docs/ and scripts/ for stale paths to docker-compose.yml, railway.json, render.yaml
- Found all references already correct:
  - config/docker/docker-compose.yml
  - config/docker/.dockerignore
  - config/deployment/railway.json
  - config/deployment/render.yaml
- No file changes needed - verification only
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase already follows proper config folder organization
  - All documentation correctly references /config/docker/ and /config/deployment/
  - No stale paths found in docs or scripts
  - Verification tasks are important to confirm existing standards before making unnecessary changes
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-013
- Created docs/TESTING_PATTERN.md with standard integration test patterns
- Documented folder structure for unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Defined naming conventions: .spec.ts, .integration.spec.ts, .e2e.spec.ts
- Included examples from existing codebase (jobs.service.spec.ts, jd-extractor.nats.spec.ts, comprehensive-api-integration.e2e.spec.ts)
- Added mock patterns for repositories, NATS services, and cache services
- Files changed:
  - `docs/TESTING_PATTERN.md` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Unit tests are co-located with source files (.spec.ts next to .ts)
  - Integration tests use .integration.spec.ts suffix in feature folders or integration/ subfolder
  - E2E tests are in test/ subfolder organized by category (integration/, security/, performance/, production/)
  - NATS integration tests follow a pattern: stub the NATS service, test event subscription and publishing
  - Repository mocks should use jest.fn() for dynamic mocking in integration tests
  - The testing pattern doc should reference actual examples from the codebase for clarity
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-014
- Applied integration test pattern to scoring-engine-svc (smallest service with 183 tests)
- Renamed integration test to follow naming convention: scoring-engine.nats.spec.ts → scoring-engine.integration.spec.ts
- Verified existing test structure already follows the pattern:
  - Unit tests co-located with source files
  - Integration tests in integration/ subfolder
  - NATS integration tests use stub pattern for testing event handlers
- All 183 tests pass
- Files changed:
  - `apps/scoring-engine-svc/src/integration/scoring-engine.integration.spec.ts` (renamed)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - scoring-engine-svc already had good test structure - only needed file rename
  - The NATS integration test pattern uses a stub class that captures handler functions for direct invocation
  - Integration tests in integration/ subfolder should use .integration.spec.ts suffix
  - Test runs: 10 test suites, 183 tests passing in ~20 seconds
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-015
- Created feature-flags/ domain folder in libs/shared-dtos
- Moved feature-flag.dto.ts and audit-event.dto.ts to feature-flags/ folder
- Updated libs/shared-dtos/src/index.ts to export from new location
- All imports use barrel exports (@ai-recruitment-clerk/shared-dtos), so no direct import updates needed
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/feature-flags/feature-flag.dto.ts` (moved)
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/feature-flags/audit-event.dto.ts` (moved)
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/index.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The shared-dtos library already has a domains/ folder with domain-specific DTOs (analytics, incentive, questionnaire, usage-limit, user-management)
  - Barrel export pattern in index.ts means moving files doesn't require import updates as long as exports are re-exported
  - Feature flags domain was small (2 files) - good candidate for incremental refactor
  - Documentation (specs/002-cicd-quality-migration/tasks.md) references old paths but those are just comments
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-016
- Completed DTO reorganization by moving error-response.dto.ts to errors/ folder
- Updated relative import in error-response-formatter.ts: '../error-response.dto' → './error-response.dto'
- Updated libs/shared-dtos/src/index.ts to export from errors/error-response.dto
- All DTOs now properly grouped by domain folders
- Files changed:
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/errors/error-response.dto.ts` (moved)
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/errors/error-response-formatter.ts` (updated import)
  - `libs/shared-dtos/src/index.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Phase 1 (US-015) and Phase 2 (US-016) completed the DTO reorganization incrementally
  - When moving files that have internal imports, need to update relative paths
  - The error-response.dto.ts had a relative import in error-response-formatter.ts that needed updating
  - Barrel export pattern in index.ts kept most imports working without changes
  - All DTOs are now in domain folders: feature-flags/, errors/, domains/, models/, events/, auth/, privacy/, etc.
---
## [2026-02-04] - US-017
- Created shared Logger class in libs/infrastructure-shared/src/logging
- Implemented Logger class with error, warn, log, debug, verbose methods
- Added contextual logging support with LogContext interface (traceId, requestId, userId, operation)
- Created child logger pattern via child() and setContext() methods
- Exported Logger, createLogger, and default logger instance from infrastructure-shared
- Created docs/LOGGING.md with usage examples, best practices, and migration guide
- Files changed:
  - `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/logging/logger.service.ts` (new)
  - `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/logging/index.ts` (new)
  - `libs/infrastructure-shared/src/index.ts` (updated - added logging re-exports)
  - `docs/LOGGING.md` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Used NestJS's built-in Logger as the underlying implementation to maintain compatibility
  - The LoggerWithContext class needed a protected getNestLogger() method to access the parent's nest logger
  - Log format includes context in message string: "Message [operation] trace:xxx req:yyy user:zzz"
  - The default logger instance provides quick access without explicit instantiation
  - Documentation included migration guide from console.log to logger.log
