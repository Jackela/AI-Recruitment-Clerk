## Codebase Patterns
- Use `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any` for dynamic objects
- Schema properties use `!` assertion with @Prop({ default: ... })
- Add `public` modifier to class properties and methods
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- ESLint rules are in eslint.config.mjs
- Replace `Function` type with `(...args: unknown[]) => unknown`
- CRITICAL: Main branch has pre-existing typecheck errors - these must be fixed before quality checks can pass
- Domain aggregates and value objects need `public` modifier on factory methods (create, restore), getters, and all public methods
- Use `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` for interface methods that need backward compatibility (e.g., event bus, audit logger)

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added public accessibility modifiers to all static methods in ContractValidator class
- Files changed: libs/api-contracts/src/validation/contract.validator.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The api-contracts library only needs 4 method accessibility fixes
  - Static methods need `public static` not just `static`
  - Typecheck passes after these fixes
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-002
- What was implemented: Added public accessibility modifiers and return types to shared-nats-client library
- Files changed:
  - libs/shared-nats-client/src/config/stream-configs.ts
  - libs/shared-nats-client/src/nats-client.module.ts
  - libs/shared-nats-client/src/services/nats-client.service.ts
  - libs/shared-nats-client/src/services/nats-connection-manager.service.ts
  - libs/shared-nats-client/src/services/nats-stream-manager.service.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NestJS modules need `DynamicModule` return type for static `forRoot()` methods (not generic object types)
  - Use `import type { DynamicModule }` to avoid circular dependency issues
  - NestJS lifecycle hooks like `onModuleInit` and `onModuleDestroy` need explicit `Promise<void>` return types
  - 36 accessibility modifier warnings were fixed across 5 files
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-003
- What was implemented: Fixed all 49 lint warnings in infrastructure-shared library
- Files changed:
  - libs/infrastructure-shared/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The PredicateFunction type uses `any[]` and must keep it - changing to `unknown[]` breaks many service contracts that depend on it
  - Use `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` to preserve backward compatibility when `any` is intentional
  - Interface methods like `switchToHttp()`, `handle()` should return `Record<string, unknown>` or `unknown` instead of `any`
  - Function types: `getHandler()` -> `(...args: unknown[]) => unknown`, `getClass()` -> `new (...args: unknown[]) => unknown`
  - 49 warnings fixed: 26 accessibility modifiers, 8 return types, 6 `any` type replacements
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-004
- What was implemented: Fixed all 18 lint warnings in candidate-scoring-domain library
- Files changed:
  - libs/candidate-scoring-domain/src/application/dtos/feedback-scoring.dto.ts
  - libs/candidate-scoring-domain/src/application/dtos/scoring-templates.dto.ts
  - libs/candidate-scoring-domain/src/domain/domain-services/skills-taxonomy.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Domain libraries have DTOs in `application/dtos/` and services in `domain/domain-services/`
  - Replace `any` with `Record<string, unknown>` for questionnaire data and scoring breakdowns
  - SkillsTaxonomy class has 9 public static methods that needed accessibility modifiers
  - 18 warnings fixed: 15 accessibility modifiers, 3 `any` type replacements
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-005
- What was implemented: Fixed all 6 lint warnings in report-generation-domain library
- Files changed:
  - libs/report-generation-domain/src/application/dtos/report-templates.dto.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ReportPromptTemplates class has 4 static methods for generating prompt templates
  - ReportPromptBuilder class has 2 static methods for building prompts with options
  - All 6 warnings were accessibility modifiers on static methods
  - This is a small, focused domain library with minimal lint issues
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-006
- What was implemented: Fixed all 113 lint warnings in usage-management-domain library

  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/application/dtos/usage-limit.dto.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/aggregates/usage-limit.aggregate.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/domain-services/usage-limit.domain-service.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/domain-services/usage-limit.rules.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/ip-address.value-object.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/quota-allocation.value-object.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/usage-limit-check-result.value-object.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/usage-limit-id.value-object.ts

  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/usage-record-result.value-object.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/usage-record.value-object.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/usage-statistics.value-object.ts
  - libs/usage-management-domain/src/domain/value-objects/usage-tracking.value-object.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This is the largest domain library with 113 warnings across 13 files
  - Domain patterns: aggregate roots have factory methods (create/restore), business methods, getters
  - Value objects have static factory methods (createDefault/restore), getters, and accessor methods
  - Interface methods for external services (IDomainEventBus, IAuditLogger) need `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` when they accept generic event/data objects
  - Use nullish coalescing (`??`) instead of non-null assertion (`!`) to avoid forbidden non-null assertion warnings
  - UsageLimitData interface uses `Record<string, unknown>` for nested object properties (policy, quotaAllocation, usageTracking)
  - UsageLimitRules class has many static constants and static methods that all need `public static readonly` or `public static`
  - 113 warnings fixed: ~80 accessibility modifiers, ~25 getters, 4 non-null assertions replaced, 5 `any` types preserved with eslint-disable

## 2026-02-01 - US-007
- What was implemented: Fixed all 113 lint warnings in incentive-system-domain library
- Files changed:
  - libs/incentive-system-domain/src/application/dtos/incentive.dto.ts
  - libs/incentive-system-domain/src/domain/aggregates/incentive.aggregate.ts
  - libs/incentive-system-domain/src/domain/base/value-object.ts

  - libs/incentive-system-domain/src/domain/value-objects/incentive-summary.value-object.ts
  - libs/incentive-system-domain/src/domain/value-objects/incentive-trigger.value-object.ts
  - libs/incentive-system-domain/src/domain/value-objects/payment-result.value-object.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CRITICAL: eslint-disable comments must be placed directly above the line with `any`, not above the method signature
  - Example: For `triggerData: any` parameter, place `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` on the line before `triggerData: any`, not before the method
  - IncentiveData interface uses `any` for recipient, reward, trigger properties that represent different value object types - keep with eslint-disable
  - Replace non-null assertions (`!`) with nullish coalescing (`??`) for optional properties like `paymentResult.amount!` → `paymentResult.amount ?? 0`
  - 113 warnings fixed across 12 files: ~80 accessibility modifiers, ~25 getters, 4 non-null assertions, 4 `any` types preserved with eslint-disable

  - libs/marketing-domain/src/domain/value-objects/user-experience.value-object.ts
  - libs/marketing-domain/src/domain/value-objects/user-profile.value-object.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Marketing-domain follows similar structure to other domain libraries with aggregates, value objects, domain services, and contracts
  - QuestionnaireData interface uses `any` for template, submission, quality, metadata properties - keep with eslint-disable
  - QuestionnaireSubmissionResult class has nested `any` in data.summary property - needs eslint-disable on the line with `any`
  - IDomainEventBus interface publish method needs `any` for generic event types
  - Value object restore methods commonly use `any` parameter type - add eslint-disable-next-line directly above the parameter line
  - 106 warnings fixed across 16 files: ~85 accessibility modifiers (static methods & getters), 12 `any` types preserved with eslint-disable
