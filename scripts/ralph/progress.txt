## Codebase Patterns
- **ESM Module System**: Project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json. All configs should use ESM imports unless there's a specific Nx requirement for CJS.
- **Nx/Webpack Integration**: The @nx/webpack/app-plugin exports can be imported from '@nx/webpack/app-plugin.js' with .js extension in ESM.
- **Rollback Documentation**: Always create docs/ROLLBACK-US-{id}.md with multiple rollback options (revert, manual patch, config change) and verification steps.
- **CommonJS Output**: Even with ESM configs, webpack can be configured to output CommonJS (see `experiments.outputModule: false` and `filename: 'main.cjs'`).
- **Batch Verification**: Run lint + typecheck + build together before committing to ensure all quality gates pass.

## 2026-02-03 - US-001
- What was implemented: Verified existing ESM webpack.config.js works correctly; no code changes needed
- Files changed:
  - Created: docs/ROLLBACK-US-001.md (comprehensive rollback plan)
  - Updated: scripts/ralph/prd.json (marked US-001 as passing)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The webpack.config.js was already using ESM correctly with `import` statements and .js extension in imports
  - All acceptance criteria passed: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`
  - The project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, so ESM configs are the right approach
  - Nx properly handles ESM webpack configs - no need for CJS wrappers
  - Rollback plans should include multiple options: git revert, config change, manual patch
  - Always verify with batched commands (lint + typecheck + build) before committing
