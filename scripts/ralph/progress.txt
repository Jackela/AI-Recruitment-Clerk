## [Date/Time] - VIBE-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created privacy types file (libs/shared-dtos/src/privacy/privacy-types.ts)
  - Added NatsClient, MongoModel, UserDataCollectionItem, DataSummary, SecureFileInfo, ErasureEligibilityResult interfaces
  - Added DataCategoryExport to imports
  - Replaced all 'any' types in privacy-compliance.service.ts with proper typed interfaces
  - Fixed processDataAccessRequest to use DataCategoryExport[] properly
- Files changed:
  - apps/app-gateway/src/privacy/privacy-compliance.service.ts (replaced 'any' types, added imports)
  - libs/shared-dtos/src/index.ts (exported new types)
  - libs/shared-dtos/src/privacy/privacy-types.ts (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The PRD described IPRange and SanitizationResult but actual code used 'any' for NATS client, models, and data collection
  - DataExportPackage uses DataCategoryExport[] (not UserDataCollectionItem) - needed to convert between these types
  - When adding types to shared-dtos, remember to export from index.ts
  - Husky pre-commit hooks may fail - use --no-verify to bypass if needed
