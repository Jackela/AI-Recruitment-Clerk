## Codebase Patterns

- **Angular Component Splitting**: Extract display logic to `*-display.component.ts`, filter logic to `*-filter.component.ts`, business logic to `mobile-*.service.ts`
- **DTO Splitting Pattern**: Extract domain events, interfaces, types, and result classes to separate files; use barrel re-export for backward compatibility
- **Test Splitting Pattern**: Extract shared test data/helpers, then split by feature area; all test files under 500 lines
- **Service State Management**: Use BehaviorSubject pattern for reactive state; combineLatest for derived state
- **ESM Only**: All projects use `"type": "module"`; webpack configs use `.cjs` extension as exception
- **TypeScript Strict**: No `any` types, explicit types required, strict mode enabled
- **Line Limit**: All files under 500 lines maximum

## [Fri Feb 14 2026] - CODE-003-3
- Extracted candidate card display (avatar, name, title, score) into `mobile-candidate-card.component.ts`
- Created `CandidateCardData` interface with types for status and match level
- Also extracted skill tags into `mobile-skill-tags.component.ts` to meet <400 line target
- Also extracted quick actions menu into `mobile-quick-actions-menu.component.ts`
- Reduced `mobile-results-item.component.ts` from 600 to 353 lines
- All new components use @Input for data, @Output for events
- Files changed:
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-candidate-card.component.ts` (new, 211 lines)
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-skill-tags.component.ts` (new, 68 lines)
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-quick-actions-menu.component.ts` (new, 112 lines)
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-results-item.component.ts` (reduced from 600 to 353 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When extracting display components, also extract related UI elements (skill tags, action menus) to meet line targets
  - Reusable types (CandidateStatus, CandidateMatch, QuickActionMenuItem) should be exported from child components
  - Component extraction often requires adjusting layout (flex-direction: column) in parent
  - Already existing `mobile-quick-actions.component.ts` is a horizontal scroll bar, not a dropdown menu - use different naming

## [Fri Feb 14 2026] - CODE-003-1
- Extracted mobile-navigation header section into separate `mobile-navigation-header.component.ts`
- Created `HeaderAction` interface for type safety
- Updated `MobileNavigationComponent` to use child component with @Input/@Output bindings
- Files changed:
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-navigation-header.component.ts` (new, 403 lines)
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-navigation.component.ts` (reduced from 635 to 306 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Header components need both `isScrolled` and `isMenuOpen` inputs for state
  - Export `HeaderAction` type from header component for parent components to use
  - The hamburger animation styles stay with the header component

## [Fri Feb 14 2026] - CODE-003-2
- Verified bottom navigation extraction was already complete
- `mobile-bottom-nav.component.ts` exists (163 lines) with full styling
- `mobile-navigation.component.ts` reduced to 182 lines (well under 450 target)
- Component uses @Input for navItems and isActive function
- Quality checks: typecheck passes, test passes (no tests for this component)
- Files verified:
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-bottom-nav.component.ts` (163 lines)
  - `apps/ai-recruitment-frontend/src/app/components/mobile/mobile-navigation.component.ts` (182 lines)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Bottom nav components can receive isActive as function input for route checking
  - Parent component can bind service methods directly: `[isActive]="service.method.bind(service)"`
  - Always verify if work was already done before starting implementation
