# GDPR Data Mapping Report - AI Recruitment Clerk

## Executive Summary

The AI Recruitment Clerk platform processes significant amounts of personal data across multiple microservices. This report identifies all personal data processing activities and establishes the foundation for GDPR compliance implementation.

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Processing sensitive employment/career data with limited privacy controls
**Compliance Status**: 5/10 - Critical gaps in consent management, data subject rights, and privacy infrastructure
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Legal operation in EU markets requires immediate action

## Data Processing Activities Map

### 1. Authentication & User Management
**Service**: app-gateway, user management domain
**Data Processed**:
- Identity: Email, first name, last name
- Credentials: Hashed passwords, JWT tokens
- Authorization: User roles, organization affiliations
- Audit: Account creation, login timestamps, IP addresses

**Legal Basis**: Contract performance (account management)
**Retention**: Indefinite (requires policy implementation)
**Cross-border**: No adequacy decision documented

### 2. Resume Processing Pipeline
**Services**: resume-parser-svc, app-gateway, report-generator-svc
**Data Processed**:
- Personal Identity: Full name, email, phone numbers

- Education: Degrees, institutions, certifications
- Skills: Technical and soft skills assessments
- Documents: Original resume files, parsed data structures

**Legal Basis**: Contract performance (resume analysis service)
**Retention**: No defined retention policy
**Third-party Processing**: Gemini AI (Google) - no DPA identified
**Cross-border**: Data shared with Google Cloud (US) - adequacy assessment required

### 3. Analytics & Behavioral Tracking
**Services**: app-gateway analytics domain, all frontend interactions
**Data Processed**:
- Session Data: User sessions, device fingerprints, browser data
- Behavioral: Page views, interaction events, form submissions
- Performance: System metrics linked to user sessions
- Location: IP-based geolocation, timezone data

**Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest (system improvement) + Consent (behavioral analytics)
**Consent Management**: EXISTS but incomplete - ConsentStatus enum in use
**Retention**: Automated (90-1095 days based on event type)
**Third-party Processing**: None identified

### 4. Guest Usage Tracking
**Services**: app-gateway guest domain, frontend guest services
**Data Processed**:
- Device Identification: Device fingerprints, generated IDs
- Usage Patterns: Service usage count, frequency analysis
- Engagement: Feedback codes, redemption patterns

**Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest (service limitation enforcement)
**Retention**: No defined policy
**Data Minimization**: Partial - anonymous device IDs used

### 5. Job & Matching Data
**Services**: app-gateway jobs domain, scoring-engine-svc
**Data Processed**:
- Job Preferences: Search criteria, application history
- Matching Results: Compatibility scores, ranking data
- Creator Data: Job posting attribution (user ID references)

**Legal Basis**: Contract performance (job matching service)
**Retention**: No defined policy

## Current Privacy Infrastructure Assessment

### Existing Controls (Partial)
✅ **Consent Framework**: ConsentStatus enum with GRANTED/DENIED/PENDING/NOT_APPLICABLE
✅ **Data Anonymization**: Analytics events support anonymization methods
✅ **Encryption**: Password hashing, encryption service available
✅ **Session Management**: JWT-based authentication with expiration

### Critical Gaps
❌ **Consent Management UI**: No user-facing consent capture interface
❌ **Data Subject Rights**: No automation for access, rectification, erasure, portability
❌ **Data Retention**: No automated deletion policies
❌ **Breach Notification**: No 72-hour reporting capability
❌ **DPA Documentation**: No third-party data processing agreements
❌ **Privacy Notices**: No comprehensive privacy policy
❌ **Cross-border Compliance**: No adequacy decisions or SCCs

## Third-Party Data Sharing Analysis

### Google Gemini AI Integration
**Data Shared**: Resume content, job descriptions, user-generated content
**Purpose**: AI-powered text analysis and processing
**Location**: Google Cloud (US)
**Legal Mechanism**: NONE IDENTIFIED - CRITICAL RISK
**Recommendation**: Implement Google Cloud DPA, adequacy decision documentation

### Infrastructure Services
**MongoDB, Redis, NATS**: Data at rest and in transit
**Docker/Container Orchestration**: Application data processing
**Monitoring Systems**: Performance data with user correlation

## Data Flow Analysis

### High-Risk Data Flows
1. **Resume Upload → Gemini AI**: Personal data to non-EU processor without DPA
2. **Analytics Collection**: Behavioral tracking without explicit consent
3. **Guest Tracking**: Device fingerprinting with indefinite retention
4. **Cross-service Correlation**: User data linked across all microservices

### Privacy-by-Design Gaps
1. **Default Privacy Settings**: Users enrolled in all tracking by default
2. **Data Minimization**: Extensive data collection without necessity assessment
3. **Purpose Limitation**: Analytics data used for unspecified purposes
4. **Storage Limitation**: No retention limits on most data categories

## Regulatory Compliance Assessment

### GDPR Article Compliance Status
- **Article 6 (Lawfulness)**: 60% - Legal basis documented but consent gaps
- **Article 7 (Conditions for consent)**: 20% - No consent capture mechanism
- **Article 9 (Special categories)**: 80% - Limited special category data
- **Article 12-22 (Data subject rights)**: 10% - No automated rights implementation
- **Article 25 (Privacy by design)**: 30% - Limited privacy-by-design implementation
- **Article 30 (Records of processing)**: 0% - No data processing records
- **Article 33-34 (Breach notification)**: 0% - No breach procedures
- **Article 35 (DPIA)**: 0% - No privacy impact assessments

### Immediate Legal Risks
1. **Unlawful Processing**: Analytics without consent
2. **Inadequate Legal Basis**: Third-party data sharing
3. **No Data Subject Rights**: Violation of Articles 15-21
4. **Missing Documentation**: No processing records (Article 30)

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### CRITICAL (Week 1-2)
1. Consent management system implementation
2. Data subject rights automation (access, erasure)
3. Google Cloud DPA and adequacy documentation
4. Privacy policy and terms of service

### HIGH (Week 3-4)
1. Data retention policies and automation
2. Breach notification system
3. Data processing records (Article 30)
4. Privacy impact assessment framework

### MEDIUM (Week 5-8)
1. Enhanced privacy-by-design implementation
2. Cross-border transfer documentation
3. Employee training and policies
4. Compliance monitoring and reporting
