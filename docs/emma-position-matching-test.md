  {skill: "Jest", matchType: "exact", score: 1.0, weight: 0.6},
  {skill: "Webpack", matchType: "exact", score: 1.0, weight: 0.5}
]

// All required skills matched + all optional skills matched
criticalCoverage = 4/4 = 100%
overallCoverage = 6/6 = 100%
weightedScore = 95% (perfect skill alignment)
```

#### Experience Score Prediction: 100%
```typescript
// Dynamic weights for mid-level role

}

// Emma's experience: 4.17 years vs 2-5 required
baseScore = Math.min(100, (4.17/2) * 100) = 100
relevanceBonus = +7 points (91% relevant experience)
recencyBonus = +4 points (all recent experience)
leadershipBonus = +2 points (some leadership language)
progressionBonus = +9 points (ascending career)
finalExperienceScore = 100 (capped)
```

#### Education Score: 100%
```typescript
// Bachelor's CS meets Bachelor's requirement perfectly
educationScore = 100%
```

#### Overall Score Prediction: 96-98%
```typescript
overallScore = (95% * 0.5) + (100% * 0.3) + (100% * 0.2) = 97.5%
```

**üòä Emma's Reaction**: "97%! This is exactly the kind of role where I'd be confident and successful."

  "educationLevel": "bachelor",
  "seniority": "senior", 
  "leadershipRequired": true,
  "industryContext": "Technology"
}
```

### Expected Scoring Analysis

#### Skills Score Prediction: 75-80%
```typescript
skillMatches = [
  {skill: "React", matchType: "exact", score: 1.0, weight: 1.0},
  {skill: "TypeScript", matchType: "exact", score: 1.0, weight: 1.0},
  {skill: "JavaScript", matchType: "exact", score: 1.0, weight: 0.9},
  {skill: "Frontend Architecture", matchType: "semantic", score: 0.7, weight: 0.9}, // Weak match
  {skill: "Team Leadership", matchType: "semantic", score: 0.6, weight: 0.8}, // Limited evidence
  // Missing: Performance Optimization, Mentoring
]

// Critical skills: 3 strong + 2 weak matches out of 5 required
criticalCoverage = 3.3/5 = 66%
overallSkillScore = 78%
```

#### Experience Score Prediction: 70-75%
```typescript
// Dynamic weights for senior role (experience emphasized)
weights = {
  skills: 0.45,       // Reduced from 0.5
  experience: 0.35,   // Increased from 0.3
  education: 0.15,    // Reduced from 0.2
  culturalFit: 0.05   // Small cultural component
}

// Emma's experience: 4.17 years vs 5-8 required  
baseScore = (4.17/5) * 100 = 83.4% // Below minimum
leadershipBonus = +5 points (some evidence)
progressionBonus = +8 points (good trajectory)
finalExperienceScore = 83% // Below requirements hurts
```

#### Overall Score Prediction: 76-80%
```typescript
overallScore = (78% * 0.45) + (83% * 0.35) + (100% * 0.15) + (70% * 0.05) = 79%
```

**ü§î Emma's Analysis**: "79% is borderline. I'm technically qualified but clearly not the strongest candidate for senior roles yet."

  {skill: "TypeScript", matchType: "exact", score: 1.0, weight: 0.6},
  // Missing: Express.js, MongoDB, REST APIs, AWS
]

// Critical skills: Only 1.6 out of 5 required skills matched
criticalCoverage = 1.6/5 = 32%
overallSkillScore = 48%
```

#### Experience Score Prediction: 85-90%
```typescript
// Experience years met (4.17 vs 3-6 required)
baseScore = Math.min(100, (4.17/3) * 100) = 100%
relevanceAdjustment = -10 points // Lower relevance for full-stack
finalExperienceScore = 90%
```

#### Overall Score Prediction: 62-67%
```typescript
overallScore = (48% * 0.5) + (90% * 0.3) + (100% * 0.2) = 68%
```

**üòü Emma's Reality Check**: "68% confirms I'm not ready for full-stack roles yet. I need to build backend skills first."
