### 3. Career Gaps & Transitions  
- **Question**: "How does the AI handle my 6-month learning gap?"
- **Test**: Does it penalize career transitions or recognize skill development?

### 4. Resume Optimization
- **Question**: "How can I improve my chances without being dishonest?"
- **Test**: Compare current vs. optimized resume scores

### 5. Position Alignment

- **Test**: Score comparison across different seniority levels

### 6. Skill Recognition
