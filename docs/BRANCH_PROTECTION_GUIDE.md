# Branch Protection Setup Guide

**Project**: AI Recruitment Clerk  
**Purpose**: Configure branch protection rules on GitHub  
**Target Branches**: `main`, `develop`  
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## üìã Overview

Branch protection prevents accidental pushes, enforces code review, and ensures quality gates pass before merging. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up branch protection rules.

---

## üéØ Protection Goals

- ‚úÖ Prevent direct pushes to `main` and `develop`
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ‚úÖ Enforce CI/CD checks pass before merge
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up-to-date
- ‚úÖ Prevent force pushes and deletions
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass

---

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Repository admin access
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions
- Repository must have CI/CD workflows configured

### Step 1: Navigate to Branch Protection Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
3. In left sidebar, click **Branches** (under "Code and automation")

### Step 2: Add Branch Protection Rule for `main`

1. Click **Add branch protection rule**
2. Enter branch name pattern: `main`

### Step 3: Configure Protection Rules for `main`

**Required Settings**:

#### ‚úÖ Pull Request Requirements
```
‚òë Require a pull request before merging
  ‚òë Require approvals: 1
  ‚òë Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  ‚òê Require review from Code Owners (optional for single-person projects)
  ‚òë Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews
  ‚òë Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests (only for admins in emergencies)
```

#### ‚úÖ Status Checks
```
‚òë Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚òë Require branches to be up to date before merging
  
  Select status checks (add after first CI run):
  ‚òë quality-check (TypeScript, Lint)
  ‚òë test-suite (Unit tests)
  ‚òë build-check (Build verification)
```

#### ‚úÖ Commit Requirements
```
‚òë Require conversation resolution before merging
‚òë Require signed commits (optional but recommended)
‚òê Require linear history (optional - prevents merge commits)
‚òê Require deployments to succeed before merging (if using GitHub Deployments)
```

#### ‚úÖ Additional Restrictions
```
‚òë Lock branch (for emergency read-only mode)
‚òë Do not allow bypassing the above settings
‚òê Restrict who can push to matching branches (optional)
```

#### ‚úÖ Force Push & Deletion Protection
```
‚òê Allow force pushes (KEEP UNCHECKED for main)
  ‚òê Everyone
  ‚òê Specify who can force push

‚òê Allow deletions (KEEP UNCHECKED for main)
```

### Step 4: Save Protection Rule

1. Scroll to bottom
2. Click **Create** button
3. Confirm rule is listed

### Step 5: Add Branch Protection Rule for `develop`

Repeat Steps 2-4 with these modifications:

**Branch name pattern**: `develop`

**Modified Settings**:
```
‚òë Require a pull request before merging
  ‚òë Require approvals: 1 (can be 0 for faster development)
  ‚òë Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  
‚òë Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚òë Require branches to be up to date before merging
  
  Select status checks:
  ‚òë quality-check
  ‚òë test-suite
  ‚òë build-check

‚òë Require conversation resolution before merging

‚òê Allow force pushes (KEEP UNCHECKED)
‚òê Allow deletions (KEEP UNCHECKED)
```

| **Up-to-date Branch** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Prevent merge conflicts |
| **Conversation Resolution** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | All comments addressed |
| **Signed Commits** | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | Security best practice |
| **Linear History** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional | ‚ùå | Cleaner history (optional) |
| **Allow Force Push** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Prevent history rewriting |
| **Allow Deletion** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Prevent accidental deletion |

## üö® Status Checks Configuration

### Initial Setup (Before First CI Run)

You **cannot** add status checks until they've run at least once. Therefore:

1. Create branch protection rule **without** status checks
2. Run CI/CD workflow on a test PR
3. Return to branch protection settings
4. Edit rule to add status checks

### Required Status Checks

After CI runs successfully, add these checks:

```yaml
# From .github/workflows/ci.yml
‚úÖ quality-check          # TypeScript + Lint
‚úÖ test-suite            # Unit tests
‚úÖ build-check           # Build verification
‚úÖ e2e-tests (optional)  # End-to-end tests
‚úÖ security-scan (if enabled)  # CodeQL security analysis
```

### How to Add Status Checks

1. Go to branch protection rule
2. Click **Edit** button
3. Scroll to "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Search for check names (e.g., "quality-check")
5. Click to select each check
6. Save changes

---

## üîê Advanced Configurations

### For Team Repositories

```
‚òë Require review from Code Owners
  - Automatically requests reviews from CODEOWNERS
  
‚òë Restrict who can push to matching branches
  - Select: admins, maintainers
  - Prevents junior devs from bypassing PR process
  
‚òë Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews
  - Select: admins only
  - Prevents self-approval bypass
```

### For Open Source Projects

```
‚òë Require approval from someone with write access
  - External contributors cannot self-merge
  
‚òë Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Ensures all forks pass CI
  
‚òë Restrict who can push to matching branches
  - Maintainers only
```

### For Enterprise Projects

```
‚òë Require signed commits
  - Verify commit authenticity
  
‚òë Require deployments to succeed before merging
  - Ensure staging deployment works
  
‚òë Lock branch (emergency use)
  - Temporarily freeze all changes
```

## üß™ Testing Branch Protection

### Test Checklist

#### Test 1: Direct Push Prevention
```bash
git checkout main
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test: direct push"
git push origin main
```
**Expected**: ‚ùå Push rejected

#### Test 2: PR Without Approval
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and push
3. Create PR
4. Try to merge without approval

**Expected**: ‚ùå Merge button disabled

#### Test 3: PR Without CI Passing
1. Create PR with failing tests
2. Try to merge

**Expected**: ‚ùå Merge blocked by status checks

#### Test 4: PR With Approval and Passing CI
1. Create PR
2. Get approval
3. CI passes
4. Merge

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Merge succeeds

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Reviews (Monthly)

- [ ] Verify status checks are still valid
- [ ] Review bypass permissions
- [ ] Check if rules need adjustment
- [ ] Audit merge history for violations

### Updating Status Checks

When adding new CI workflows:

1. Run workflow at least once
2. Edit branch protection rule
3. Add new status check
4. Save changes

### Temporarily Disabling Protection (Emergency Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Only in critical production incidents**

1. Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Edit protection rule
3. Uncheck required settings
4. Document reason in incident log
5. **Re-enable immediately after fix**

---

## üìù Branch Protection Policy

### Policy Statement

> All production branches (`main`) and integration branches (`develop`) MUST have branch protection enabled at all times. Exceptions require written approval from project lead and must be documented.

### Enforcement

- **Automated**: GitHub enforces rules automatically
- **Audit**: Monthly review of protection settings
- **Incident Response**: Documented process for emergency overrides

### Violations

- Direct push to protected branch: Immediate revert + incident report
- Bypassing required reviews: Review process audit
- Disabling protection without approval: Escalation to project lead

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't Add Status Checks

**Solution**: Status checks must run at least once before they appear in the list.

1. Create a test PR
2. Let CI run completely
3. Return to branch protection settings
4. Status checks should now be available

### Problem: Merge Button Disabled Even After Approval

**Possible Causes**:
- Branch not up-to-date with base
- CI checks haven't passed
- Conversations not resolved
- Signed commits required but not provided

**Solution**: Check "Merge" section for specific blocker

### Problem: Admin Can't Bypass Protection

**Solution**: 
1. Edit branch protection rule
2. Enable "Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests"
3. Add admin username
4. Save changes

### Problem: Force Push Needed for Rebase

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Only on feature branches, never `main` or `develop`

**Solution**:
```bash
git push origin feature/branch --force-with-lease
```

Protection rules only apply to `main` and `develop`, not feature branches.
