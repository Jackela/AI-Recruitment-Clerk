## 🧮 Basic Experience Calculations

### Total Experience Calculation
```typescript
// Position 1: TechStart Solutions (Current)
startDate = new Date("2022-03-01")
endDate = new Date() // Present (assume 2025-01-15)
months1 = (2025 - 2022) * 12 + (1 - 3) = 36 - 2 = 34 months

// Position 2: InnovateCorp  
startDate = new Date("2021-06-01")
endDate = new Date("2022-02-28")
months2 = (2022 - 2021) * 12 + (2 - 6) = 12 - 4 = 8 months

// Position 3: StartupHub
startDate = new Date("2020-09-01") 
endDate = new Date("2021-05-31")
months3 = (2021 - 2020) * 12 + (5 - 9) = 12 - 4 = 8 months

totalYears = (34 + 8 + 8) / 12 = 50/12 = 4.17 years
```

**😊 Emma's Surprise**: "Wait, I actually have 4+ years of experience! I was underestimating myself by thinking it was only 3 years."

### Recent Experience (Last 3 Years)
```typescript
cutoffDate = new Date("2022-01-15") // 3 years ago

// All my experience is within the last 3 years!
recentYears = 4.17 years
```

## 📈 Experience Score Calculation

### Dynamic Weighting Factors
```typescript
// For mid-level frontend role
recencyWeight = 0.2 // Standard for non-senior roles
relevanceWeight = 0.4 // High for specialized role  
leadershipBonus = 0.05 // Some leadership detected
progressionBonus = 0.1 // Ascending career trend
industryPenalty = 0.0 // No penalty - tech experience for tech role
```

### Score Breakdown Calculation

#### 1. Base Experience Score
```typescript
experienceRatio = 4.17 / 2 = 2.085 // Well above minimum
baseExperienceScore = Math.min(100, 2.085 * 100) = 100
```

#### 2. Relevance Adjustment  
```typescript
relevanceRatio = 3.8 / 4.17 = 0.91 // 91% relevant
relevanceAdjustment = (0.91 - 0.5) * 40 = 16.4 points
weightedRelevanceAdj = 16.4 * 0.4 = 6.56 points
```

#### 3. Recency Adjustment
```typescript
recentRatio = 4.17 / 4.17 = 1.0 // All experience is recent
recencyAdjustment = (1.0 - 0.3) * 30 = 21 points  
weightedRecencyAdj = 21 * 0.2 = 4.2 points
```

#### 4. Leadership Bonus
```typescript
leadershipBonus = 0.05 * 100 = 5 points
```

#### 5. Progression Bonus  
```typescript
progressionBonus = 85 * 0.1 = 8.5 points
```

#### 6. Final Score Calculation
```typescript
finalScore = 100 + 6.56 + 4.2 + 5 + 8.5 = 124.26
cappedScore = Math.min(100, 124.26) = 100
```

**🎉 Emma's Reaction**: "100%! My experience perfectly fits this role!"

## 🚨 Career Gap Analysis

### Gap Detection Algorithm
```typescript
// Sort experiences by start date
sortedExperience = [
  {startDate: "2020-09-01", endDate: "2021-05-31"}, // StartupHub
  {startDate: "2021-06-01", endDate: "2022-02-28"}, // InnovateCorp  
  {startDate: "2022-03-01", endDate: "present"}      // TechStart
]

// Check gaps between positions
gap1 = new Date("2021-06-01") - new Date("2021-05-31") = 1 day (normal transition)
gap2 = new Date("2022-03-01") - new Date("2022-02-28") = 1 day (normal transition)

totalGapMonths = 0
```

**😅 Emma's Relief**: "No gaps detected! I actually had seamless transitions between my positions."

**⚠️ Emma's Concern**: "But wait, I did have a 6-month learning period that I mentioned in my summary. The AI might not catch this from the dates alone."

### Gap Impact on Scoring
```typescript
// Since no gaps detected in dates:
gapPenalty = 0 points

// However, if I mention the learning gap in my summary:
// AI might detect this during semantic analysis and apply different logic
```

## 🏢 Industry Experience Analysis  

### Company Industry Classification
```typescript
// AI would classify each company:
industryExperience = {
  "Technology": 4.17 years, // All positions classified as tech

}
```

### Industry Relevance Assessment
For a Technology sector role:
- ✅ **Perfect match**: All experience in tech industry
