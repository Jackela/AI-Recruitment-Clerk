## Open Vulnerabilities

- None. `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` captured at 2025-10-30T21:34:15+11:00 reports zero high/moderate findings.

## Remediation Decisions

- `@playwright/test@1.54.x` - Owner: Platform Engineering - Strategy: Upgrade to `@playwright/test@1.56.1` (transitively installs `playwright@1.56.1`) - Target: 2025-10-31 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30
- `axios@1.11.x` - Owner: Platform Engineering - Strategy: Upgrade to `axios@1.13.1` - Target: 2025-10-31 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30
- `nodemailer@<7.0.7` - Owner: Communications Services - Strategy: Upgrade to `nodemailer@7.0.10` - Target: 2025-10-31 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30
- `validator@<13.15.20` - Owner: Domain Services Guild - Strategy: Override to `validator@13.15.20` and dedupe under `class-validator@0.14.2` - Target: 2025-10-31 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30
- `@module-federation/*` suite - Owner: Frontend Platform - Strategy: Override to `0.21.2` series and align Nx packages to `21.5.2` - Target: 2025-11-01 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30
- `koa@3.0.2` - Owner: Frontend Platform - Strategy: Override to `koa@3.1.1` via package overrides - Target: 2025-11-01 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30
- `@angular` toolchain `<20.3.8/9` - Owner: Frontend Platform - Strategy: Align Angular build and CLI packages to `20.3.8/20.3.9`, Zone.js to `0.15.1` - Target: 2025-11-01 - Status: Completed 2025-10-30

|---------------|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| `@playwright/test@1.54.x` / `playwright@1.54.x` (High) | Platform Engineering | Upgrade to `@playwright/test@1.56.1` (transitively installs `playwright@1.56.1`) | 2025-10-31 | Completed 2025-10-30 |
| `axios@1.11.x` (High) | Platform Engineering | Upgrade to `axios@1.13.1` | 2025-10-31 | Completed 2025-10-30 |
| `nodemailer@<7.0.7` (Moderate) | Communications Services | Upgrade to `nodemailer@7.0.10` | 2025-10-31 | Completed 2025-10-30 |
| `validator@<13.15.20` (Moderate) via `class-validator` | Domain Services Guild | Override to `validator@13.15.20` and ensure `class-validator@0.14.2` consumers dedupe | 2025-10-31 | Completed 2025-10-30 |
| `@module-federation/*` suite (Moderate) through Nx plugins | Frontend Platform | Override to `0.21.2` series and align Nx packages to `21.5.2` | 2025-11-01 | Completed 2025-10-30 |
| `koa@3.0.2` (Moderate) | Frontend Platform | Override to `koa@3.1.1` via package overrides | 2025-11-01 | Completed 2025-10-30 |
| Angular toolchain packages `<20.3.8/9` (Moderate transitive exposure) | Frontend Platform | Align Angular build and CLI packages to `20.3.8/20.3.9`, Zone.js to `0.15.1` | 2025-11-01 | Completed 2025-10-30 |

## Verification Evidence

- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate --json` rerun at 2025-10-30T21:34:15+11:00 → no high/moderate vulnerabilities (stored in `data/security/dependency-inventory.json`).
- Release gate summary generated by `scripts/dependency-gate.mjs` at 2025-10-30T21:34:16+11:00 confirms `status: "clear"` (see `data/security/release-gate-summary.json`).
- GitHub Actions `dependency-scan` (`act -j dependency-scan`) completed successfully on 2025-10-30 with zero blocking findings.

## Remediation SLA Tracking

- Detection timestamp: 2025-10-30T07:32:47Z (initial release gate run showing 3 high / 13 moderate vulnerabilities).
- Remediation completion timestamp: 2025-10-30T21:34:16+11:00 (release gate status cleared).
- SLA outcome: Closed within same business day (< 2 business days) — **PASS**.

## Approvals & Sign-off

- Security Board Representative: A. Patel (2025-10-30) — Reviewed remediation decisions and validated evidence via release gate summary.

## Release Gate Notes

- Release gate enforced via `.github/workflows/security.yml` — job now fails when any high/moderate vulnerability persists.
- Gate output enhanced to enumerate vulnerability owners derived from this log; current run indicates no outstanding items.
