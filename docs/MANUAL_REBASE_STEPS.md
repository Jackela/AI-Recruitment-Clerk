# Manual Git Rebase Directive for AI Developer Agent

## üéØ Objective

**Mission**: Clean up the project's Git commit history by squashing approximately 25-30 recent commits into exactly 4 logical commits that follow Conventional Commits specification.

**Critical Success Criteria**: 
- Preserve all code changes and functionality
- Create clean, logical commit history
- Maintain chronological order of development phases
- Follow Conventional Commits specification exactly

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITES

### 1. Safety Backup Creation

**MANDATORY**: Before beginning any rebase operation, create a complete backup branch:

```bash
# Create backup branch from current state
git branch backup-before-rebase-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Verify backup was created
git branch -v | grep backup
```

**Validation**: Ensure backup branch shows in the output with current commit hash.

### 2. Working Directory Assessment

**Current State Analysis Required**:

The working directory contains **significant uncommitted changes** that represent completed development work:

- **58 modified files** including E2E test infrastructure improvements
- **31 untracked files** including new selectors, tests, and documentation
- **Recent commits span approximately 25-30 commits** requiring consolidation

**MANDATORY ACTION**: All uncommitted changes MUST be committed before starting the rebase:

```bash
# Stage all changes for commit
git add .

# Create a comprehensive commit with all current work
git commit -m "WIP: Complete current development session

- Implement NgRx selectors and comprehensive unit tests
- Resolve all E2E test failures including WebKit compatibility
- Decompose oversized components and improve code structure
- Add comprehensive E2E testing infrastructure and monitoring
- Fix production build issues and bundle optimization
- Complete frontend refactoring and accessibility improvements

This commit captures all work completed in the current session
before performing interactive rebase to clean up commit history."
```

**Verification**: `git status` should show "working tree clean" before proceeding.

## üîß INTERACTIVE REBASE EXECUTION

### Step 1: Identify Rebase Range

**Determine the commit range** by finding the last commit before the development work began:

```bash
# Find the commit that should remain unchanged (base commit)
git log --oneline -40 | grep -E "(Merge pull request|Initial|Setup)"

# Expected result should show a commit like "24d5446 Merge pull request #18"
# This represents the stable base before recent development work
```

**Select Base Commit**: Use the commit hash from the merge or initial setup commit (approximately `24d5446` based on current history).

### Step 2: Initiate Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Start interactive rebase from the base commit
# Replace XXXXXXX with the actual base commit hash identified in Step 1
git rebase -i 24d5446

# Alternative: Count commits from HEAD if base is unclear
# git rebase -i HEAD~30
```

**Expected Result**: This opens an interactive editor showing approximately 25-30 commits.

### Step 3: Rebase Plan Configuration

**In the interactive rebase editor**, configure the commits as follows:

```
# Rebase Instructions Template
# 
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but squash into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]

# TARGET STRUCTURE (apply this configuration):

# === GROUP 1: Infrastructure and Production (OLDEST) ===
pick c643766  # Fix: Railway deployment config - nixpacks + port mapping + build command
squash a87cac7 # Fix: Build and start scripts - ensure dependencies and frontend build

squash 1a9bee4 # üåä Wave 7: Complete infrastructure fix for Railway production
squash 69698a7 # fix: nixpacks build configuration for Railway deployment
squash b49c7b3 # Fix Railway deployment - optimize build command and add ignore file
squash fa2da85 # fix: streamline CI/CD pipeline and resolve core issues

# === GROUP 2: State Management (SECOND) ===
pick 7334392  # First commit with state management work

# (State management commits will be identified during rebase)

# === GROUP 3: Frontend Refactoring (THIRD) ===  
pick 92f52c0  # Refractor
squash aee204f # Update
squash a79f505 # REfractor
squash 7d71962 # FrontEnd Refractor
squash 18c774d # Wave 4A: Hybrid Architecture - NestJS backend + Enhanced frontend integration
squash 51f50b9 # Wave 3E: Force enhanced server via nixpacks direct start
squash 5397e23 # Wave 3D: Test enhanced server directly - bypass NestJS build temporarily
squash b4baba6 # Wave 3C: Add enhanced server fallback with full AI recruitment interface

# === GROUP 4: E2E Testing (NEWEST) ===
pick [CURRENT] # WIP: Complete current development session (the commit we just created)
# This contains all the E2E work and will become the E2E testing commit

```

### Step 4: Commit Message Configuration

**For each "pick" commit** (the first commit in each group), the rebase will prompt for commit messages. Use EXACTLY these messages:

#### Message 1 (Infrastructure - OLDEST):

## üö® ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY

### Conflict Resolution

**When merge conflicts occur during rebase**:

1. **Identify conflict files**:
```bash
git status
# Look for files marked as "both modified"
```

2. **Resolve conflicts manually**:
   - Open each conflicted file
   - Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
   - Choose the correct content (usually keep both sets of changes)
   - Save the file

3. **Continue rebase**:
```bash
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

### Rebase Abortion and Recovery

**If rebase becomes problematic**:

```bash
# Abort current rebase and return to original state
git rebase --abort

# Restore from backup if needed
git checkout backup-before-rebase-[timestamp]
git checkout -b retry-rebase-attempt
```

### Common Error Scenarios

#### 1. **Empty Commit Error**
```
error: cannot squash without a previous commit
```
**Solution**: Ensure the first commit in each group uses `pick`, not `squash`.

#### 2. **Editor Configuration Issues**
```bash
# If rebase editor doesn't open properly
git config core.editor "code --wait"  # For VS Code
# OR
git config core.editor "nano"         # For nano
```

#### 3. **Commit Message Rejection**
**Issue**: Long commit messages may be rejected
**Solution**: Keep first line under 72 characters, use blank line before detailed description.

---

## ‚úÖ POST-REBASE VALIDATION

### 1. Verify Commit History

```bash
# Check that exactly 4 commits exist from base
git log --oneline -10

# Expected output should show 4 commits with exact conventional commit messages
```

### 2. Validate Working Directory

```bash
# Ensure working directory is clean
git status

# Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```

### 3. Functional Testing

```bash
# Verify build still works
npm run build

# Verify tests still pass  
npm run test

# Verify application still functions
npm run dev
```

### 4. Commit Message Compliance Check

**Verify each commit message follows Conventional Commits**:
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types used: `feat`, `refactor`, `fix`
- Scopes used: `core`, `state`, `frontend`, `e2e`
- Description starts with lowercase verb

---

## üîÑ FORCE PUSH CONSIDERATIONS

**CRITICAL**: After successful rebase, the Git history has been rewritten.

### Local Repository Confirmation

```bash
# Confirm local history is correct
git log --oneline -5

# Should show exactly 4 commits with conventional commit messages
```

### Remote Push Strategy

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Force push will overwrite remote history

```bash
# Safe force push (recommended)
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Only use regular force push if force-with-lease fails
git push --force origin main
```

**Validation**: After push, verify remote repository shows clean history with 4 commits.

---

## üìä SUCCESS CRITERIA CHECKLIST

---

## üîß EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Complete Recovery from Backup

**If rebase fails catastrophically**:

```bash
# Return to backup
git checkout backup-before-rebase-[timestamp]

# Create new working branch
git checkout -b recovery-attempt

# Re-approach rebase with smaller chunks if necessary
```

### Partial Recovery Strategy

**If some commits are successfully rebased**:

```bash
# Note current position
git log --oneline -10

# Return to backup
git checkout backup-before-rebase-[timestamp]

# Cherry-pick successfully rebased commits
git cherry-pick [commit-hash-1] [commit-hash-2]
```
