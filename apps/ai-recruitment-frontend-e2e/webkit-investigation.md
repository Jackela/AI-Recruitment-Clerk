# WebKit Server Compatibility Investigation

**Issue**: WebKit browser tests consistently fail due to server connection errors  
**Status**: Requires server-side investigation  
**Priority**: Low (does not affect primary browsers Chromium and Firefox)  
**Date**: 2025-08-28

## Problem Summary

WebKit (Safari engine) tests fail consistently with `ECONNRESET` errors when attempting to connect to the Angular development server on port 4202.

## Error Pattern

```
Error: read ECONNRESET
    at TCP.onStreamRead (node:internal/stream_base_commons:216:20)
Emitted 'error' event on Socket instance at:
    at emitErrorNT (node:internal/streams/destroy:170:8)
    at emitErrorCloseNT (node:internal/streams/destroy:129:3)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:90:21)
{
  errno: -4077,
  code: 'ECONNRESET',
  syscall: 'read'
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Observed Behavior

1. **Chromium**: Connects successfully, all tests pass
2. **Firefox**: Connects successfully after optimizations, all tests pass
3. **WebKit**: Server crashes immediately upon connection attempt

### Investigation Findings

- The error occurs at the TCP socket level during WebKit's initial connection
- Server restarts automatically but crashes again on subsequent WebKit connection attempts
- Issue appears to be related to how WebKit's networking stack interacts with the Angular dev server
- Not related to Playwright configuration or browser launch options

### Attempted Solutions ‚ùå

1. **Extended Timeouts**: Increased navigation and action timeouts to 60+ seconds
2. **WebKit Launch Arguments**: Added compatibility flags (`--disable-web-security`, `--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor`)
3. **Connection Retry Logic**: Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanisms
4. **Headless Mode**: Forced headless execution for stability
5. **Sequential Execution**: Prevented parallel WebKit tests
6. **Alternative Test Approaches**: Created simplified WebKit-specific tests

**Result**: All approaches failed - the fundamental connection issue persists

## Technical Details

### Environment

- **Server**: Angular development server (Nx/Vite based)
- **Port**: 4202
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (bound to all interfaces)
- **WebKit Version**: Playwright's bundled WebKit engine
- **Platform**: Windows 11, Node.js v22.17.0

### Error Context

- Error occurs in Node.js TCP stream handling
- Happens during initial HTTP request processing
- Server process terminates abnormally (not a graceful shutdown)
- Suggests incompatibility between WebKit's HTTP client and the dev server

## Investigation Requirements

### Server-Side Analysis Needed

1. **Server Compatibility Testing**:
   - Test WebKit connectivity against different server implementations
   - Try alternative development servers (webpack dev server, express static server)
   - Analyze server HTTP handling for WebKit-specific requests

2. **Network Stack Investigation**:
   - Capture network traffic during WebKit connection attempts
   - Compare HTTP headers and connection patterns between browsers
   - Check for WebKit-specific connection behaviors

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - **Production Build Testing**: Test WebKit against production builds instead of dev server
   - **Proxy Server**: Use intermediate proxy that's compatible with WebKit
   - **Container Testing**: Run tests against containerized application

### Dev Server Analysis

1. **Request Analysis**: Log and analyze the exact HTTP requests WebKit makes
2. **Error Handling**: Improve server error handling for edge cases
3. **Configuration Review**: Check Nx/Vite dev server WebKit compatibility settings

## Workaround Options

### Short-term Solutions

1. **Skip WebKit Tests**: Continue with Chromium and Firefox coverage (current approach)
2. **Separate WebKit Environment**: Run WebKit tests against production build
3. **CI/CD Alternative**: Use different WebKit testing approach in CI pipeline

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Server Upgrade**: Upgrade to WebKit-compatible development server
2. **Custom WebKit Server**: Build minimal HTTP server for WebKit testing
3. **Remote WebKit Testing**: Use cloud-based WebKit testing services

## Business Impact Assessment

### Risk Level: **LOW**

- **Coverage**: 67% browser coverage (2/3 major engines)
- **Market Share**: WebKit primary on Apple devices (~15-20% desktop, higher mobile)
- **Functionality**: Core application functionality tested on other browsers
- **User Impact**: Limited - application likely works fine on Safari in production

### Recommendation

**DEFER** - Continue with current 2-browser coverage while focusing on higher-priority development tasks. Address WebKit compatibility when resources permit or if Safari-specific issues are reported in production.

## Implementation Plan (If Pursued)

### Phase 1: Diagnostic (2-4 hours)

1. Set up network traffic monitoring
2. Create minimal reproduction case
3. Test against alternative servers
4. Document specific WebKit request patterns

### Phase 2: Server Solutions (4-8 hours)

1. Implement server compatibility fixes
2. Test production build compatibility
3. Create WebKit-specific test environment
4. Validate full test suite functionality

### Phase 3: Integration (2-4 hours)

1. Integrate WebKit tests back into main pipeline
2. Update monitoring and reporting systems
3. Document solution for future maintenance
4. Create runbook for WebKit-specific issues

**Total Estimated Effort**: 8-16 hours of investigation and implementation time

## Current Status

- **Issue Classification**: Infrastructure compatibility limitation
- **Workaround Status**: ‚úÖ Active (skip WebKit tests)
- **Alternative Coverage**: ‚úÖ Chromium and Firefox provide comprehensive testing
- **Production Impact**: üü° Low risk (application likely works on Safari)
- **Priority**: Low - address if resources available or production Safari issues emerge

## Contact/Escalation

For server-side investigation, involve:

1. **DevOps/Infrastructure team** for server configuration analysis
2. **Frontend team** for alternative development server options
3. **QA team** for production Safari testing validation
